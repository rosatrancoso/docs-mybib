abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Royal Meteorological Society. The current study presents AEOLUS-RIO2016, an ultrahigh resolution wind forecasting system that was developed and implemented operationally for supporting the Hellenic Olympic Sailing Team during the sailing events at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Summer Olympic Games. The forecasting system was built around the state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction Weather Research and Forecasting model, ported to a high performance computing infrastructure that ensured the reliability and timeliness of the provided service. Advanced web mapping tools were employed for communicating forecasts effectively to the athletes and coaches throughout the period of the sailing events. Prior to the operational deployment of AEOLUS-RIO2016, sensitivity experiments were carried out, focusing on the representation of topography and land use and aiming at improving wind forecasts. The results suggest that the employment of very high resolution and up-to-date terrestrial data allowed model performance to be improved, especially in terms of the wind direction guidance provided. Considering the period of the sailing events, the evaluation of AEOLUS-RIO2016 revealed an overall satisfactory performance. Notably, however, it was found that the system failed to provide reliable wind guidance on specific days. A posteriori implementation of the model using an alternative source for providing initial and lateral boundary conditions showed notable improvements in model performance.},

@article{Macleod2017a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Royal Meteorological Society. Wind power forecasts are useful tools for power load balancing, energy trading and wind farm operations. Long range monthly-to-seasonal forecasting allows the prediction of departures from average weather conditions beyond traditional weather forecast timescales, months in advance. However, it has not yet been demonstrated how these forecasts can be optimally transformed to wind power. The predictable part of a seasonal forecast is for longer monthly averages, not daily averages, but to use monthly averages misses information on variability. To investigate, here a model relating average weather conditions to average wind power output was built, based on the relationship between instantaneous wind speed and power production and incorporating fluctuations in air density due to temperature and wind speed variability. Observed monthly average power output from UK stations was used to validate the model and to investigate the optimal temporal resolution for the data used to drive the model. Multiple simulations of wind power were performed based on reanalysis data, making separate simulations based on monthly, daily and sub-daily averages, using a distribution defined by the mean across the period to incorporate information on variability. Basing the simulation on monthly averages alone is sub-optimal: using daily average winds gives the highest correlation against observations. No improvement over this is gained by using sub-daily averages or including temperature variability. This signifies that to transform seasonal forecasts to wind power a compromise must be made between using the daily averages with debatable skill and the more predictable monthly averages, losing information on day-to-day variability.},

abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting-the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit. FROM THE REVIEWS: TECHNOMETRICS "This is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use them. Examples and especially the visualizations are principle features...As a source for the methods of statistical learning...it will probably be a long time before there is a competitor to this book."},

abstract = {The second version of the NCEP Climate Forecast System (CFSv2) was made operational at NCEP in March 2011. This version has upgrades to nearly all aspects of the data assimilation and forecast model components of the system. A coupled reanalysis was made over a 32-yr period (1979–2010), which provided the initial conditions to carry out a comprehensive reforecast over 29 years (1982–2010). This was done to obtain consistent and stable calibrations, as well as skill estimates for the operational subseasonal and sea- sonal predictions at NCEP with CFSv2. The operational implementation of the full system ensures a conti- nuity of the climate record and provides a valuable up-to-date dataset to study many aspects of predictability on the seasonal and subseasonal scales. Evaluation of the reforecasts show that the CFSv2 increases the length of skillfulMJOforecasts from 6 to 17 days (dramatically improving subseasonal forecasts), nearly doubles the skill of seasonal forecasts of 2-m temperatures over the United States, and significantly improves global SST forecasts over its predecessor. The CFSv2 not only provides greatly improved guidance at these time scales but also creates many more products for subseasonal and seasonal forecasting with an extensive set of ret- rospective forecasts for users to calibrate their forecast products. These retrospective and real-time opera- tional forecasts will be used by a wide community of users in their decision making processes in areas such as water management for rivers and agriculture, transportation, energy use by utilities, wind and other sus- tainable energy, and seasonal prediction of the hurricane season.},

abstract = {Climate variables responsible for inter-annual variations in the winter cereal yield in Spain were identified and climate information was translated into crop production. Empirical orthogonal functions and correlation analyses were applied to regional and large-scale climate variables to ascertain the links between climate and winter cereal yield. Interactions between climate and winter cereal productivity in Spain can be summarized as follows: the start of the growing season depends on minimum temperature, and crop maturity is affected by drought, maximum temperature, sea-level air pressure, moisture fluxes, and the jet stream, as well as by indices of the Scandinavian Pattern, the North Atlantic Oscillation, and the Southern Oscillation. A statistical approach has been derived to describe variability in cereal productivity in Spain taking into account the previous potential predictors. In general, the best atmospheric conditions for increasing winter cereal productivity in Spain are warmer winters, cooler and wet springs, with prevalent meridional circulation at upper levels. The observed trend of increasing sea level pressure toward the western Mediterranean could cause a loss in the winter cereal yield. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2007.},

abstract = {The potential modification of hydrodynamic factors, such as waves, is a source of concern for many coastal communities because of its potential effect on shoreline evolution. In the northern Atlantic, swell is created by storm winds that cross the Atlantic following west-east tracks. These tracks are shifted more southward or northward depending on the season and on recurring large-scale atmospheric pressure anomalies, also called teleconnection patterns. This study investigates the trends of sea-wave patterns in the Bay of Biscay and relates their interannual variability to teleconnection patterns. Sea-wave parameter time series from the 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40) show a satisfying correlation with an in situ buoy of M{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}o-France during the period they overlap. Using a k-means algorithm, data from this 44-yr-long time series were clustered into a few sea-state modes, each of them corresponding to an observable sea state associated with an averaged value for wave height, period, and direction. This analysis shows that most of the increase in annual mean sea-wave height since the 1970s has occurred because the relative frequency of occurrence of persistent observable sea states is evolving over time: from 1970 to 2001, the data indicate that energetic northwest swell becomes more frequent than low-energy intermediate sea states. Moreover, anomalies of the relative frequency of occurrence of observable sea states are related to large-scale recurring pressure anomalies: principally, the Northern Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) but also (during winters) the east Atlantic (EA) pattern, as well other teleconnection patterns of the Northern Hemisphere (NOAA data). 2011 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Advances in the science and observation of climate change are providing a clearer understanding of the inherent variability of Earth's climate system and its likely response to human and natural influences. The implications of climate change for the environment and society will depend not only on the response of the Earth system to changes in radiative forcings, but also on how humankind responds through changes in technology, economies, lifestyle and policy. Extensive uncertainties exist in future forcings of and responses to climate change, necessitating the use of scenarios of the future to explore the potential consequences of different response options. To date, such scenarios have not adequately examined crucial possibilities, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, and have relied on research processes that slowed the exchange of information among physical, biological and social scientists. Here we describe a new process for creating plausible scenarios to investigate some of the most challenging and important questions about climate change confronting the global community.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors. Global multimodel wave climate projections are obtained at 1.0° × 1.0° scale from 30 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) global circulation model (GCM) realizations. A semi-supervised weather-typing approach based on a characterization of the ocean wave generation areas and the historical wave information from the recent GOW2 database are used to train the statistical model. This framework is also applied to obtain high resolution projections of coastal wave climate and coastal impacts as port operability and coastal flooding. Regional projections are estimated using the collection of weather types at spacing of 1.0°. This assumption is feasible because the predictor is defined based on the wave generation area and the classification is guided by the local wave climate. The assessment of future changes in coastal impacts is based on direct downscaling of indicators defined by empirical formulations (total water level for coastal flooding and number of hours per year with overtopping for port operability). Global multimodel projections of the significant wave height and peak period are consistent with changes obtained in previous studies. Statistical confidence of expected changes is obtained due to the large number of GCMs to construct the ensemble. The proposed methodology is proved to be flexible to project wave climate at different spatial scales. Regional changes of additional variables as wave direction or other statistics can be estimated from the future empirical distribution with extreme values restricted to high percentiles (i.e., 95th, 99th percentiles). The statistical framework can also be applied to evaluate regional coastal impacts integrating changes in storminess and sea level rise.},

abstract = {In this study, dynamical and statistical downscaling methods for estimating seasonal statistics of significant wave heights (SWH) were intercompared, with the downscaling results being evaluated against the ERA40 wave data in terms of climatological characteristics and interannual variability. It was also shown that biases in climate-model-simulated climate and variability of the atmospheric circulation (or predictors in general) can result in large biases in the estimated climate and variability of SWH (or the predictand in general), and that such biases can be effectively diminished by using standardized predictor quantities in statistical downscaling models. In dynamical downscaling, however, model variability biases remain to be dealt with, whereas the effects of model climate biases can be reduced to some extent by replacing the climate-model-simulated wind climate with the observed one. Therefore, the dynamical approach was found to be not as good as the statistical methods in terms of reproducing the observed climate and interannual variability of the predictand, although it bears substantial similarity to the statistical methods in terms of projected possible future changes. Also, it was shown that the observed interannual variability of seasonal statistics (including extremes) can be better reproduced by using 12-hourly, rather than seasonal, data in statistical downscaling. This stresses the importance of availability of higher-resolution data from climate model outputs. Nevertheless, a non-stationary extreme value model with covariates was found to be the best in reproducing the observed climate of extremes. All the statistical downscaling methods and the intercomparison results are applicable to other climate variables (not limited to ocean wave heights). {\textcopyright} 2009 Crown in the right of Canada.

abstract = {Six wave stations were occupied for 2- months along a great circle between New Zealand and Alaska. Twice-daily wave records were analysed to yield energy spectra Ei(f, t) for station i as functions of frequency and time. Events from major storms appear as slanting ridges in the Es(f, t) field; the ridge linesf = (g/4(pi)) (t - to) /Ai determine source t;ime, to, and source distance, A,; rough estimates of direction Oi(f) were made at two stations. Twelve major events, including several from antipodal storms (A z 180?) in the Indian Ocean, could be clearly tracked from station to station. Source parameters are found to be mutually consistent, and usually in accord with weather information. Cuts in Ei (f, t) along the ridges give spectra firom which the effect of dispersion is removed. These were corrected for geometric spreading and island shadowing. Comparison of the corrected ridge spectra between stations indicate negligible attenuation for frequencies below 70 mc/s (less than 0-02 dB/deg between New Zealand and Alaska), and 0415 dB/deg at 80 mc/s, with a considerable scatter from event to event. At higher frequencies the events disappear into a background spectrum which is remarkably uniform over the Pacific, and presumably the result of global high winds along the entire storm belt of the South Pacific. The attenuation in the near zone of the storm (within a distance comparable to the storm diameter) is estimated at 0-2 dB/deg at 70 mc/s and 0 4 dB/deg at 80 mc/s. Wave-wave interactions have been derived from a perturbation expansion of the Navier-Stokes equations. The computed attenuation due to interaction between wave groups from a storm is not inconsistent with observations in both the near and far zones. The observed super-exponential decay is attributed to the decrease in interaction efficiency with diminishing wave energy along the path and dispersive narrowing of the spectral peak. Interaction with background (such as the trade wind sea) is unimportant. The conclusion is that the observed propagation could be accounted for by the effects of Stokes interaction (? 8b,c, figure 38) between wave groups from a single storm.},

abstract = {The effect of interannual climate variability and change on the historic, directional wave climate of the Southern Hemisphere is presented. Owing to a lack of in situ wave observations, wave climate in the Southern Hemisphere is determined from satellite altimetry and global ocean wave models. Altimeter data span the period 1985 to present, with the exception of a 2-year gap in 1989-1991. Interannual variability and trends in the significant wave height are determined from the satellite altimeter record (1991 to present), and the dominant modes of variability are identified using an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. Significant wave heights in the Southern Ocean are observed to show a strong positive correlation with the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), particularly during Austral autumn and winter months. Correlation between altimeter derived significant wave heights and the Southern Oscillation Index is observed in the Pacific basin, which is consistent with several previous studies.Variability and trends of the directional wave climate are determined using the ERA-40 Waves Re-analysis for the period 1980-2001. Significant wave height, mean wave period and mean wave direction data are used to describe the climate of the wave energy flux vector. An EOF analysis of the wave energy flux vector is carried out to determine the dominant modes of variability of the directional seasonal wave energy flux climate. The dominant mode of variability during autumn and winter months is strongly correlated to the SAM. There is an anti-clockwise rotation of wave direction with the southward intensification of the Southern Ocean storm belt associated with the SAM. Clockwise rotation of flux vectors is observed in the Western Pacific Ocean during El-Nino events.Directional variability of the wave energy flux in the Western Pacific Ocean has previously been shown to be of importance to sand transport along the south-eastern Australian margin, and the New Zealand region. The directional variability of the wave energy flux of the Southern Ocean associated with the SAM is expected to be of importance to the wave-driven currents responsible for the transport of sand along coastal margins in the Southern Hemisphere, in particular those on the Southern and Western coastal margins of the Australian continent.

abstract = {A version of the WAVEWATCH III wave model featuring a continuously moving spatial grid is pre- sented. The new model option/version is intended for research into wind waves generated by tropical cyclones in deep water away from the coast. The main advantage of such an approach is that the cyclones can be modeled with spatial grids that cover much smaller areas than conventional fixed grids, making model runs with high spatial resolution more economically feasible. The model modifications necessary are fairly trivial. Most complications occur due to the Garden Sprinkler effect (GSE) and methods used to mitigate it. The basic testing of the model is performed using idealized wind fields consisting of a Ran- kine vortex. The model is also applied to hurricane Lili in the Gulf of Mexico in October 2002. The latter application shows that the moving grid approach provides a natural way to deal with hurricane wind fields that have a high-resolution in space, but a low resolution in time. Although the new model version is orig- inally intended for tropical cyclones, it is suitable for high-resolution modeling of waves due to any moving weather pattern.},

abstract = {The term ``climate services'' is commonly used to refer to the generation of climate information, their transformation according to user needs and the subsequent use of the information in decision making processes. More generally, the concept also involves contextualization of information and knowledge. In the following a series of examples from the marine sector is described covering the generation, transformation and the use of climate information in decision making processes while contextualization is not considered. Examples comprise applications from naval architecture, offshore wind and more generally renewable energies, shipping emissions, and tidal basin water exchange and eutrophication levels. Moreover effects of climate change on coastal flood damages and the need for coastal protection are considered. Based on the analysis of these examples it is concluded that reliable climate information in data sparse regions is urgently needed, that for many applications historical climate information may be as or even more important as future long-term projections, and that the specific needs of different sectors substantially depend on their planning horizons.},

abstract = {Future changes in wind-wave climate have broad implications for the operation and design of coastal, near- and off-shore industries and ecosystems, and may further exacerbate the anticipated vulnerabilities of coastal regions to projected sea-level rise. However, wind waves have received little attention in global assessments of projected future climate change. We present results from the first community-derived multi-model ensemble of wave-climate projections. We find an agreed projected decrease in annual mean significant wave height (HS) over 25.8{\%} of the global ocean area. The area of projected decrease is greater during boreal winter (January–March, mean; 38.5{\%} of the global ocean area) than austral winter (July–September, mean; 8.4{\%}). A projected increase in annual mean HS is found over 7.1{\%} of the global ocean, predominantly in the Southern Ocean, which is greater during austral winter (July–September; 8.8{\%}). Increased Southern Ocean wave activity influences a larger proportion of the global ocean as swell propagates northwards into the other ocean basins, observed as an increase in annual mean wave period (TM) over 30.2{\%} of the global ocean and associated rotation of the annual mean wave direction ($\theta$M). The multi-model ensemble is too limited to systematically sample total uncertainty associated with wave-climate projections. However, variance of wave-climate projections associated with study methodology dominates other sources of uncertainty (for example, climate scenario and model uncertainties).},

abstract = {New parameterizations for the spectra dissipation of wind-generated waves are proposed. The rates of dissipation have no predetermined spectral shapes and are functions of the wave spectrum and wind speed and direction, in a way consistent with observation of wave breaking and swell dissipation properties. Namely, the swell dissipation is nonlinear and proportional to the swell steepness, and dissipation due to wave breaking is non-zero only when a non-dimensional spectrum exceeds the threshold at which waves are observed to start breaking. An additional source of short wave dissipation due to long wave breaking is introduced to represent the dissipation of short waves due to longer breaking waves. Several degrees of freedom are introduced in the wave breaking and the wind-wave generation term of Janssen (J. Phys. Oceanogr. 1991). These parameterizations are combined and calibrated with the Discrete Interaction Approximation of Hasselmann et al. (J. Phys. Oceangr. 1985) for the nonlinear interactions. Parameters are adjusted to reproduce observed shapes of directional wave spectra, and the variability of spectral moments with wind speed and wave height. The wave energy balance is verified in a wide range of conditions and scales, from gentle swells to major hurricanes, from the global ocean to coastal settings. Wave height, peak and mean periods, and spectral data are validated using in situ and remote sensing data. Some systematic defects are still present, but the parameterizations yield the best overall results to date. Perspectives for further improvement are also given.},

@article{Dupuis2006,
abstract = {As a background, a review of long term evolution of wave climate in the North Atlantic is discussed. Most studies show that interannual evolutions in wave heights may be related to climatic factors, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation Index for example. Data of a waverider, consisting of a time series of 20 years in the Bay of Biscay (off Biscarosse, France), are analysed. Based on these data obtained from 1980, wave heights tend to decrease over the period. Also, interannual evolutions exist, particularly in the wave period. The fact that the annual wave periods at Biscarosse are found to vary more significantly than the annual wave heights led us to assume that it is an indirect effect of the evolution in the location of generating storms relative to the buoy. The relationships between wave parameters and climatic factors such as the North Atlantic Oscillation Index and the Garonne discharge have been derived: they show that the NAO index is negatively correlated with the river discharge and positively correlated with the wave period. This result is in agreement with the general climate scheme associated with NAO cycle proposed by Kushnir et al. [Kushnir, Y., Cardone, V.J., Cane, M., 1995. Link between Atlantic climate variability of surface wave height and sea level pressure. Proc. Fourth Int. Workshop on Wave Incasting and forecasting, Banff, AB, Canada, 59-64.]: NAO+ shifts storm tracks northward and dry weather are encountered in the southern part of Europe (conversely NAO- brings storm tracks and rainfall closer). Concerning wave heights, the lack of dependence on NAO index may be associated with compensation effects between wind intensity and storm tracks: wave energy is partly dissipated while reaching the Bay of Biscay in case of severe but distant storms (NAO+), which is not the case for storms generated nearer to the buoy and associated with moderate westerly winds (NOA-). However, the reason of the decrease in wave heights is not clear. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This information is extremely useful for coastal studies and can be used both directly or as boundary conditions for regional and local downscalings. This work presents the GOW2 database, a long-term wave hindcast covering the world coastline with improved resolution in coastal areas and along ocean islands. For developing the GOW2 hindcast, WAVEWATCH III wave model is used in a multigrid two-way nesting configuration from 1979 onwards. The multigrid includes a global grid of half degree spatial resolution, specific grids configured for the Arctic and the Antarctic polar areas, and a grid of higher resolution (about 25 km) for all the coastal locations at a depth shallower than 200 m. Available outputs include hourly sea state parameters (e.g. significant wave height, peak period, mean wave direction) and series of 3-h spectra at more than 40000 locations in coastal areas. Comparisons with instrumental data show a clear improvement with respect to existing global hindcasts, especially in semi-enclosed basins and areas with a complex bathymetry. The effect of tropical cyclones is also well-captured thanks to the high resolution of the forcings and the wave model setup. The new database shows a high potential for a variety of applications in coastal engineering.},

@article{Leonard1979,
abstract = {A convective modelling procedure is presented which avoids the stability problems of central differencing while remaining free of the inaccuracies of numerical diffusion associated with upstream differencing. For combined convection and diffusion the number of operations at each grid point is comparable to that of standard upstream-pluscentral differencing - however, highly accurate solutions can be obtained with a grid spacing much larger than that required by conventional methods for comparable accuracy, with obvious practical advantaged in terms of both speed and storage. The algorithm is based on a conservative control-volume formulation with cell wall values of each field variable written in terms of a quadratic interpolation using in any one coordinate direction the two adjacent nodal values together with the value at the next upstream node. This results in a convective differencing scheme with greater formal accuracy than central differencing while retaining the basic stable convective sensitivity property of upstream-weighted schemes. The consistent treatment of diffusion terms is equivalent to central differencing. With careful modelling, numerical boundary conditions are not troublesome. Some idealized problems are studied, showing the practical advantages of the method over other schemes in comparison with exact solutions. An application to a complex unsteady two-dimensional flow is briefly discussed. ?? 1979.},

abstract = {In recent years, the impact of climate change on sea surface waves has received increasingly more attention by the climate community. Indeed, ocean waves reaching the coast play an important role in several processes concerning coastal communities, such as inundation and erosion. However, regional downscaling at the high spatial resolution necessary for coastal studies has received less attention. Here, we present a novel framework for regional wave climate projections and its application in the European region. Changes in the wave dynamics under different scenarios in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean are analyzed.The multi-model projection methodology is based on a statistical downscaling approach. The statistical relation between the predictor (atmospheric conditions) and the predictand (multivariate wave climate) is based on a weather type (WT) classification. This atmospheric classification is developed by applying the k-means clustering technique over historical offshore sea level pressure (SLP) fields. Each WT is linked to sea wave conditions from a wave hindcast. This link is developed by associating atmospheric conditions from reanalysis with multivariate local waves. This predictor-predictand relationship is applied to the daily SLP fields from global climate models (GCMs) in order to project future changes in regional wave conditions. The GCMs used in the multi-model projection are selected according to skill criteria. The application of this framework uses CMIP5-based wave climate projections in Europe. The low computational requirements of the statistical approach allow a large number of GCMs and climate change scenarios to be studied.Consistent with previous works on global wave climate projections, the estimated changes from the regional wave climate projections show a general decrease in wave heights and periods in the Atlantic Europe for the late twenty-first century. The regional projections, however, allow a more detailed spatial characterization of the projected changes under different climate scenarios. For example, changes in significant wave heights for the RCP8.5 scenario for the 2070-2099 time period indicate a general decrease of about 10 cm in Southern Europe (Portuguese, Spanish and French coasts) with respect to present conditions. This decrease is due to a higher occurrence of dominant and moderate Azores high pressure systems over the North Atlantic Ocean and a decrease in the persistence of intense low pressure systems at high latitudes.},

abstract = {Objective measures of climate model performance are proposed and used to assess simulations of the 20th century, which are available from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) archive. The primary focus of this analysis is on the climatology of atmospheric fields. For each variable considered, the models are ranked according to a measure of relative error. Based on an average of the relative errors over all fields considered, some models appear to perform substantially better than others. Forming a single index of model performance, however, can be misleading in that it hides a more complex picture of the relative merits of different models. This is demonstrated by examining individual variables and showing that the relative ranking of models varies considerably from one variable to the next. A remarkable exception to this finding is that the so-called “mean model” consistently outperforms all other models in nearly every respect. The usefulness, limitations and robustness of the metrics defined here are evaluated 1) by examining whether the information provided by each metric is correlated in any way with the others, and 2) by determining how sensitive the metrics are to such factors as observational uncertainty, spatial scale, and the domain considered (e.g., tropics versus extra-tropics). An index that gauges the fidelity of model variability on interannual time-scales is found to be only weakly correlated with an index of the mean climate performance. This illustrates the importance of evaluating a broad spectrum of climate processes and phenomena since accurate simulation of one aspect of climate does not guarantee accurate representation of other aspects. Once a broad suite of metrics has been developed to characterize model performance it may become possible to identify optimal subsets for various applications.},

abstract = {The Hurricane Research Division (HRD) analyzes surface wind fields in tropical storms and hurricanes using surface wind observations and aircraft flight-level wind measurements in the vicinity of the storms. The analyzed surface wind fields for Tropical Storm Marco (1990) were compared with the wind fields used for input in the National Weather Service's Sea, Lake, and Overland Surge from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model. The HRD wind fields were also used to determine the wind speeds and directions corresponding to the storm surge at tide gauges along Florida's west coast. The observed storm surge at the gauges was compared with the storm surge computed by the SLOSH model. Time series of the SLOSH model winds were compared with time series based on the analyzed wind field at each tide gauge, because in most cases there were no wind observations available at these gauges. The comparisons of the analyzed and modeled winds and the observed and modeled storm surge show that the SLOSH model reasonably represented the extreme storm tide effects on two basins with relatively complicated coastlines. However, SLOSH overestimated surface winds in areas of offshore flow, resulting in predictions of excessive negative surge. It is suggested that real-time storm surge model calculations, based on input from real-time surface wind analyses, have potential for the support of emergency management response and infrastructure recovery efforts during and immediately following landfall.},

abstract = {This study deals with an analysis of the performance of a general circulation model (GCM) (HadCM2) in reproducing the large-scale circulation mechanisms controlling Swedish precipitation variability, and in estimating regional climate changes owing to increased CO2 concentration by using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Seasonal precipitation amounts at 33 stations in Sweden over the period 1899–1990 are used. The large-scale circulation is represented by sea level pressure (SLP) over the Atlantic–European region. The link between seasonal Swedish precipitation and large-scale SLP variability is strong in all seasons, but especially in winter and autumn. For these two seasons, the link is a consequence of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) pattern. In winter, another important mechanism is related to a cyclonic/anticyclonic structure centred over southern Scandinavia. In the past century, this connection has remained almost unchanged in time for all seasons except spring. The downscaling model that is built on the basis of this link is skilful in all seasons, but especially so in winter and autumn. This observed link is only partially reproduced by the HadCM2 model, while large-scale SLP variability is fairly well reproduced in all seasons. A concept about optimum statistical downscaling models for climate change purposes is proposed. The idea is related to the capability of the statistical downscaling model to reproduce low frequency variability, rather than having the highest skill in terms of explained variance. By using these downscaling models, it was found that grid point and downscaled climate signals are similar (increasing precipitation) in summer and autumn, while in winter, the amplitudes of the two signals are different. In spring, both signals show a slight increase in the northern and southern parts of Sweden. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2001 Royal Meteorological Society},

abstract = {This study describes the first 40 year global wave simulation derived from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research Reanalysis (NRA) surface wind fields. The NRA 10 m wind fields were input into a deep water version of a proven spectral ocean wave model adapted onto a global grid of spacing 1.25 degrees in latitude by 2.5 degrees in longitude. In situ and satellite wind and wave data sets were used to evaluate the hindcast skill. The validation showed excellent agreement not only in terms of bias and scatter but over the entire frequency distribution out to 99th percentiles of both winds and waves. A global trend analysis showed statistically significant areas of both increasing and decreasing winds and waves. The increasing trend in the northeast Atlantic and decreasing trend in the central North Atlantic are particularly well defined and consistent with changes reported in previous studies, which were linked to changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation. The trend analysis highlighted the difficulty in separating creeping inhomogeneities in the NRA winds from real climate change, illustrating the need to use homogeneous in situ measured data to confirm trends derived from model output. The trends derived from the hindcast seem reasonable in the Northern Hemisphere and may provide a good upper bound to true trends in the wind and wave climate.},

In order to choose the most adequate model configuration, the study provides details on the calibration of the experimental saet-up through a sensitivity test considering the October–December 2001 period (the 2001 super-storm event in the West Mediterranean). A daily forecast outperforms the spectral technique of pre- vious products and the boundary data from ERA-Interim reanalysis produces the most accurate estimates in terms of wind variability and hour-to-hour correspondence. According to the sensitivity test, two data sets of wind hindcast are produced: the SeaWind I (30-km horizontal resolution for a period of 60 years) and the SeaWind II (15- km horizontal resolution for 20 years). The validation of the resulting surface winds is undertaken considering two offshore observational datasets. On the one hand, hourly surface buoy stations are used to validate wind time series at specific locations; on the other hand, wind altimeter satellite observations are considered for spatial validation in the whole Mediterranean Sea. The results obtained from this validation process show a very good agreement with observations for the southern Europe region. Finally, SeaWind I and II are used to characterize offshore wind fields in the Mediterranean Sea. The statistical structure of sea surface wind is analyzed and the agreement with Weibull probability distribution is discussed. In addition, wind persistence and extreme wind speed (50 year return period) are characterized and relevant areas of wind power generation are described by estimating wind energy quantities.},

Numerical hindcasting from surface winds provides essential space-time information to complement buoy and satellite observations for studies of the marine environment. We utilize WAVEWATCH III and SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore) in a nested grid system to model basin-wide processes as well as high-resolution wave conditions around the Hawaiian Islands from 1979 to 2013. The wind forcing includes the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) for the globe and downscaled regional winds from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Long-term in-situ buoy measurements and remotely-sensed wind speeds and wave heights allow thorough assessment of the modeling approach and data products for practical application. The high-resolution WRF winds, which include orographic and land-surface effects, are validated with QuickSCAT observations from 2000 to 2009. The wave hindcast reproduces the spatial patterns of swell and wind wave events detected by altimeters on multiple platforms between 1991 and 2009 as well as the seasonal variations recorded at 16 offshore and nearshore buoys around the Hawaiian Islands from 1979 to 2013. The hindcast captures heightened seas in interisland channels and around prominent headlands, but tends to overestimate the heights of approaching northwest swells and give lower estimates in sheltered areas. The validated high-resolution hindcast sets a baseline for future improvement of spectral wave models.},

abstract = {Abstract The trends of precipitation over the Iberian Peninsula (IP) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index from December to March are compared using observations and model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3). The evaluation is performed in two multi-models as derived by averaging simulations corresponding to two experiments: one represents climate in the 20th century (20C3M) and the other the scenario with medium forcing IPCC SRES A1B in the 21st century. The NAO index shows a trend to more positive phases and precipitation tends to decrease in the case of observations, with greater significance in the NAO than in precipitation. The simulations in the 20th century underestimate the trend both in the NAO and in precipitation compared to observations. The multi-model in the 21st century indicates a change in the NAO regimes to being more positive; this leads to a reduction of precipitation over the IP. To explain the precipitation trend changes we consider the response of precipitation to the NAO, the regression between sea level pressure (SLP) over the Euro-Atlantic area onto precipitation averaged over the IP and the composite of precipitation for years with greater and lower NAO.

However, WRDBs are not quantitatively perfect and corrections using instrumental observations must be addressed before they are used; this process is called calibration. The calibration is especially relevant near the coast and in areas where the orography is complex, since in these places the inaccuracy of WRDB is evident because of the bad description of the wind fields (i.e., insufficient forcing resolution). The quantitative differences between numerical and instrumental data suggest that different corrections should be applied depending on the mean direction of the sea state.

abstract = {Winter 2009/10 had anomalously large snowfall in the central parts of the United States and in northwestern Europe. Connections between seasonal snow anomalies and the large scale atmospheric circulation are explored. An El Nino state is associated with positive snowfall anomalies in the southern and central United States and along the eastern seaboard and negative anomalies to the north. A negative NAO causes positive snow anomalies across eastern North America and in northern Europe. It is argued that increased snowfall in the southern U.S. is contributed to by a southward displaced storm track but further north, in the eastern U.S. and northern Europe, positive snow anomalies arise from the cold temperature anomalies of a negative NAO. These relations are used with observed values of NINO3 and the NAO to conclude that the negative NAO and El Nino event were responsible for the northern hemisphere snow anomalies of winter 2009/10.

abstract = {Measurements collected during the AUSWEX field campaign, at Lake George (Australia), resulted in new insights into the processes of wind wave interaction and whitecapping dissipation, and consequently new parameterizations of the input and dissipation source terms. The new nonlinear wind input term developed accounts for dependence of the growth on wave steepness, airflow separation, and for negative growth rate under adverse winds. The new dissipation terms feature the inherent breaking term, a cumulative dissipation term and a term due to production of turbulence by waves, which is particularly relevant for decaying seas and for swell. The latter is consistent with the observed decay rate of ocean swell. This paper describes these source terms implemented in WAVEWATCH III {\textregistered}and evaluates the performance against existing source terms in academic duration-limited tests, against buoy measurements for windsea-dominated conditions, under conditions of extreme wind forcing (Hurricane Katrina), and against altimeter data in global hindcasts. Results show agreement by means of growth curves as well as integral and spectral parameters in the simulations and hindcast.},

abstract = {Using NCEP–NCAR reanalysis and in situ data, evidence of important changes in the winter (December–March) cyclone climatology of the North Pacific Ocean over the past 50 years is found. The frequency and intensity of extreme cyclones has increased markedly, with associated upward trends in extreme surface winds between 25° and 40°N and major changes in cyclone–related circulation patterns in the Gulf of Alaska. Related increases in extreme wave heights are inferred from wave measurements and wave–model hindcast results. The more vigorous cyclone activity has apparently resulted from increasing upper–tropospheric winds and vertical wind shear over the central North Pacific. Such changes, which create an environment more favorable for cyclone formation and intensification, may be related to the observed modulation of El Ni{\~{n}}o–related teleconnections at decadal and longer timescales. It is intriguing that this trend has been relatively steady rather than the sudden or stepwise shifts documented for other aspects of North Pacific climate change. Increasing sea surface temperatures in the western tropical Pacific are suggested as a plausible cause of the observed changes, though other underlying mechanisms may also contribute.},

abstract = {A statistical strategy to deduct regional-scale features from climate general circulation model (GCM) simulations has been designed and tested. The main idea is to interrelate the characteristic patterns of observed simultaneous variations of regional climate parameters and of large-scale atmospheric flow using the canonical correlation technique. The large-scale North Atlantic sea level pressure (SLP) is related to the regional, variable, winter (DJF) mean Iberian Peninsula rainfall. The skill of the resulting statistical model is shown by reproducing, to a good approximation, the winter mean Iberian rainfall from 1900 to present from the observed North Atlantic mean SLP distributions. It is shown that this observed relationship between these two variables is not well reproduced in the output of a general circulation model (GCM). The implications for Iberian rainfall changes as the response to increasing atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations simulated by two GCM experiments are examined with the proposed statistical model. In an instantaneous 2 CO2'' doubling experiment, using the simulated change of the mean North Atlantic SLP field to predict Iberian rainfall yields, there is an insignificant increase of area-averaged rainfall of 1 mm/month, with maximum values of 4 mm/month in the northwest of the peninsula. In contrast, for the four GCM grid points representing the Iberian Peninsula, the change is - 10 mm/ month, with a minimum of - 19 mm/ month in the southwest. In the second experiment, with the IPCC scenario A (''business as usual'') increase of CO2, the statistical-model results partially differ from the directly simulated rainfall changes: in the experimental range of 100 years, the area-averaged rainfall decreases by 7 mm/month (statistical model), and by 9 mm/month (GCM); at the same time the amplitude of the interdecadal variability is quite different.},

abstract = {According to requirements for intercalibration of assessment methods of vegetation quality elements along the North East Atlantic region, within the scope of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD), a better classification system of coastal regions is needed. To accomplish that goal, a quantitative classification approach was launched in order to establish common typologies for assessment of this biological quality element. This was preliminarily based on a physical classification of the coastal waters that included two consecutive steps, a first one devoted to the establishment of "biotypes" (large areas), and a latter one dealing with recognition of the variability within biotypes (" subtypological variants"). The NEA region coastline was subdivided into 550 consecutive stretches (40 km long). Then, physical variables (sea surface temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, wave exposure, tidal range and salinity) were calculated in reference points of each stretch, 5. km from the coast. This information was based mostly on satellite acquired data, using specific procedures proposed in this work. Physical typologies of NEA coastal waters were obtained by statistical analyses. Five different biotypes were selected (i.e. coastal sectors of the European coast) by national experts as baseline information to be used on intercalibration of assessment methods for vegetation within the WFD. Variability of environmental conditions on those biotypes was also analyzed and compared with previous classifications carried out at the national scale. Results from this study showed the feasibility of this methodological approach as a useful tool for assessment of the actual homogeneity of coastal environments. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

This is done by comparing ERA-40 data with results from the NCEP–NCAR reanalysis and also by investigating a known relationship between a modeled (latent heat flux) and an external (SST) quantity. The direct comparison between the two reanalyses reveals a lot of inhomogeneities. They occur mainly in the Southern Hemisphere and before 1980. While observational density was sufficient to effectively constrain the models in the Northern Hemisphere, it was not in the Southern Hemisphere. From the investigation of the relationship between latent heat flux and SST it is found that, because of an increasing amount of data, the reanalysis results become more reliable toward the end of the reanalysis period (approximately after 1980). When using the reanalysis data to investigate climate change issues care has to be taken not to confuse the inhomogeneities with real changes.},

abstract = {In this study, projections of seasonal means and extremes of ocean wave heights were made using projections of sea level pressure fields conducted with three global climate models for three forcing-scenarios. For each forcing-scenario, the three climate models projections were combined to estimate the multi-model mean projection of climate change. The relative importance of the variability in the projected wave heights that is due to the forcing prescribed in a forcing-scenario was assessed on the basis of ensemble simulations conducted with the Canadian coupled climate model CGCM2. The uncertainties in the projections of wave heights that are due to differences among the climate models and/or among the forcing-scenarios were characterized. The results show that the multi-model mean projection of climate change has patterns similar to those derived from using the CGCM2 projections alone, but the magnitudes of changes are generally smaller in the boreal oceans but larger in the region nearby the Antarctic coastal zone. The forcing-induced variance (as simulated by CGCM2) was identified to be of substantial magnitude in some areas in all seasons. The uncertainty due to differences among the forcing-scenarios is much smaller than that due to differences among the climate models, although it was identified to be statistically significant in most areas of the oceans (this indicates that different forcing conditions do make notable differences in the wave height climate change projection). The sum of the model and forcing-scenario uncertainties is smaller in the JFM and AMJ seasons than in other seasons, and it is generally small in the mid-high latitudes and large in the tropics. In particular, some areas in the northern oceans were projected to have large changes by all the three climate models.},

abstract = {Global observations of ocean swell, from satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar data, are used to estimate the dissipation of swell energy for a number of storms. Swells can be very persistent with energy e-folding scales exceeding 20,000 km. For increasing swell steepness this scale shrinks systematically, down to 2800 km for the steepest observed swells, revealing a significant loss of swell energy. This value corresponds to a normalized energy decay in time {\{}$\backslash$ss{\}} = 4.2 x 10-6 s -1 . Many processes may be responsible for this dissipation. Because no particular trend is found with wind magnitude and direction, the increase of dissipation rate in dissipation with swell steepness is interpreted as a laminar to turbulent transition of the boundary layer, with a threshold Reynolds number of the order of 100,000. These observations of swell evolution open the way for more accurate wave forecasting models, and provides a constraint on swell-induced air-sea fluxes of momentum and energy.},

abstract = {Abstract A long-term dataset of satellite altimeter measurements of significant wave height and wind speed, spanning 23 years, is analyzed to determine extreme values corresponding to a 100-yr return period. The analysis considers the suitability of both the initial distribution method (IDM) and peaks-over-threshold (POT) approaches and concludes that for wave height both IDM and POT methods can yield reliable results. For the first time, the global POT results for wave height show spatial consistency, a feature afforded by the larger dataset. The analyses also show that the POT approach is sensitive to spatial resolution. Since wind speed has greater spatial and temporal variability than wave height, the POT approach yields unreliable results for wind speed as a result of undersampling of peak events. The IDM approach does, however, generate extreme wind speed values in reasonable agreement with buoy estimates. The results show that the altimeter database can estimate 100-yr return period significant wav...},

It is argued that the dissipation source term has to be modeled using two explicit constituents. A low-frequency dissipation term analogous to wave energy loss due to oceanic turbulence is therefore augmented with a diagnostic high-frequency dissipation term. The dissipation is tuned for the model to represent idealized fetch-limited growth behavior. The new model results in excellent growth behavior from extremely short fetches up to full development. For intermediate to long fetches results are similar to those of WAM, but for extremely short fetches the present model presents a significant improvement (although the poor behavior of WAM appears to be related to correctable numerical constraints). The new model furthermore gives smoother results and appears less sensitive to numerical errors. Finally, limitations of the present source terms and possible improvements are discussed.},

The large-scale physical characteristics of the atmosphere, ocean and sea ice are well simulated.

The surface temperatures are too cold, with the exception of the Southern Ocean region and parts of the Northern Hemisphere extratropics. The main patterns of interannual climate variability are well represented. Experiments with enhanced CO2 concentrations show well-known responses of Arctic amplification, land-sea contrasts, tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling. The global climate sensitivity of the current version of EC-Earth is slightly less than 1 K/(W m−2). An intensification of the hydrological cycle is found and strong regional changes in precipitation, affecting monsoon characteristics.

The period investigated runs from 1979 to 1998. In order to assess the performance of the models, averaged seasonal cycles and probability density functions (PDFs) calculated from model simula- tions are compared with the corresponding seasonal cycles, whilst PDFs are also obtained using the data from the ERA40 reanalysis and the Global Precipitation Climatology Project. We found that simulated PDFs generally provided a better fit to actual PDFs than seasonal cycles do. This conclusion indicates that when evaluating model perfor- mance, the climate variability as measured by means of PDFs is not the only climatic element that should be tested. Regarding the comparison based on the seasonal cycle, results also show that the root mean square skill score is more useful than the r skill score. To rank the AR4 models, sea level pressure, surface air temperature and precipitation variables were selected and a group of five AR4 models were identified as the models which best reproduce current climate in the area: MIROC3.2-HIRES, MPI-ECHAM5, GFDL-CM2.1, BCCR-BCM2.0 and UKMO-HADGEM1. The rank obtained should not be understood in a hierarchical manner because there is a certain degree of internal variability in the model ensem- bles. Finally, it should be noted that these results are in good agreement with other classifications found in the scientific literature.},

abstract = {This study proposes a computationally inexpensive statistical method for modeling ocean wave heights, focusing particularly on modeling wave heights in near-shore areas. A multiple linear regression is used to predict significant wave heights (H s) using predictors derived from the sea level pressure (SLP) field, including the use of squared SLP gradients to represent geostrophic winds. One time step lagged H s is also included as a predictor, which could be interpreted as the first order derivative in the spectral energy balance governing equation. Further, based on the frequency/directional dispersion theory of waves, the swell component is accounted for by using a set of selected principal components derived from the squared SLP gradient vectors (including magnitudes and directions). The effect of non-Gaussian (non-negative) variables is also assessed by applying two types of transformation to the data.The proposed method is evaluated and shown to have good skills for the study area (Catalan coast). This method can be used to project possible future wave climate change for use in coastal impact assessment studies. It is used in this study to project the wave climate for the study area that corresponds to 5 sets of regional climate model (RCM) atmospheric projections, which were made by different RCMs forced by the same global circulation model (GCM), or by the same RCM forced by two GCMs. For the season analyzed (winter), the results show that the uncertainty due to using different GCMs to drive the same RCM is greater than that due to using different RCMs driven by the same GCM. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Early instrumental pressure measurements from Gibraltar and the Reykjavik area of Iceland have been used to extend to 1821 the homogeneous pressure series at the two locations. In winter the two sites are located close to the centres of action that comprise the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAG). The extended 'winter half-year' record of the NAO enables recent changes in the record to be placed in the context of the period 1823-1996. The period since the early 1970s is the most prolonged positive phase of the oscillation and the late 1980s and early 1990s is the period with the highest values (strongest westerlies). The winter of 1995-1996 marked a dramatic switch in the index, with the change from 1994-1995 being the greatest change recorded from one year to the next since the series began in 1823.

abstract = {The dominant characteristics of wave energy variability in the eastern North Pacific are described from NOAA National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoy data collected from 1981 to 2003. Ten buoys at distributed locations were selected for comparison based on record duration and data continuity. Long-period (LP) [T {\textgreater} 12] s, intermediate-period [6 ≤ T ≤ 12] s, and short-period [T {\textless} 6] s wave spectral energy components are considered separately. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analyses of monthly wave energy anomalies reveal that all three wave energy components exhibit similar patterns of spatial variability. The dominant mode represents coherent heightened (or diminished) wave energy along the West Coast from Alaska to southern California, as indicated by composites of the 700 hPa height field. The second EOF mode reveals a distinct El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-associated spatial distribution of wave energy, which occurs when the North Pacific storm track is extended unusually far south or has receded to the north. Monthly means and principal components (PCs) of wave energy levels indicate that the 1997–1998 El Ni{\~{n}}o winter had the highest basin-wide wave energy within this record, substantially higher than the 1982–1983 El Ni{\~{n}}o. An increasing trend in the dominant PC of LP wave energy suggests that storminess has increased in the northeast Pacific since 1980. This trend is emphasized at central eastern North Pacific locations. Patterns of storminess variability are consistent with increasing activity in the central North Pacific as well as the tendency for more extreme waves in the south during El Ni{\~{n}}o episodes and in the north during La Ni{\~{n}}a.},

abstract = {European temperatures and their projected changes under the 8.5 W/m2 Representative Concentration Pathway scenario are evaluated in an ensemble of 33 global climate models participating in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Respective contributions of large-scale dynamics and local processes to both biases and changes in temperatures, and to the inter-model spread, are then investigated from a recently proposed methodology based on weather regimes. On average, CMIP5 models exhibit a cold bias in winter, especially in Northern Europe. They overestimate summer temperatures in Central Europe, in association with a greater diurnal range than observed. The projected tem- perature increase is stronger in summer than in winter, with the highest summer warming occurring over Mediterranean regions. Links between biases and sensitivities are evi- denced in winter, suggesting a potential influence of snow cover biases on the projected surface warming. A brief analysis of daily temperature extremes suggests that the intra-seasonal variability is projected to decrease (slightly increase) in winter (summer). Then, in order to understand model discrepancies in both present-day and future cli- mates, we disentangle effects of large-scale atmospheric dynamics and regional physical processes. In particular, in winter, CMIP5 models simulate a stronger North-Atlantic jet stream than observed and, in contrast with CMIP3 results, the majority of them suggests an increased fre- quency of the negative phase of the North-Atlantic Oscil- lation under future warming. While large-scale circulation only has a minor contribution to ensemble-mean biases or changes, which are primarily dominated by non-dynamical processes, it substantially affects the inter-model spread. Finally, other sources of uncertainties, including the North- Atlantic warming and local radiative feedbacks related to snow cover and clouds, are briefly discussed},

In this approach, a series of grids with different resolutions are treated as individual wave models, while simultaneously and continuously considering interactions between these grids. This converts a mosaic of grids into a single wave model. For overlapping grids with distinctly different resolutions, two-way nesting is introduced. For overlapping grids with similar resolution, a reconciliation method is introduced. These techniques are implemented in the WAVEWATCH III wind wave model and are tested for several idealized situations, and for a realistic wave hindcast for coastal Alaskan waters. The mosaic approach is shown to give consistent results across grid scales and provides an effective and economical way to locally increase the spatial resolution of wave models.},

The 20CR SLP data set for the North Atlantic has been reported to be homogeneous since 1871, although it has discontinuities before 1949 in other regions. A multivariate regression model with lagged dependent variable is used to represent the SLP-Hsrelationship. It is calibrated and validated using the ERA-Interim reanalysis ofHs and SLP for the period 1981–2010.Trends in the reconstructed annual mean and maximum Hs are found to be consistent with those derived from two dynamical wave reanalysis data sets (MSC50 and ERA40), which indicates robustness of the trend estimates. The trend patterns of extreme Hsgenerally feature increases in the northeast North Atlantic with decreases in the mid-latitudes; but there are seasonal variations. The main features of the patterns of trends over the last half century or so are also seen in the last 140-yr period (1871–2010). However, the trend magnitudes are much greater in the last half century than in the 140 years.},

abstract = {The performance of a set of 15 global climate models used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project is evaluated for Alaska and Greenland, and compared with the performance over broader pan-Arctic and Northern Hemisphere extratropical domains. Root-mean-square errors relative to the 1958-2000 climatology of the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) are summed over the seasonal cycles of three variables: surface air temperature, precipitation, and sea level pressure. The specific models that perform best over the larger domains tend to be the ones that perform best over Alaska and Greenland. The rankings of the models are largely unchanged when the bias of each model's climatological annual mean is removed prior to the error calculation for the individual models. The annual mean biases typically account for about half of the models' root-mean-square errors. However, the root-mean-square errors of the models are generally much larger than the biases of the composite output, indicating that the systematic errors differ considerably among the models. There is a tendency for the models with smaller errors to simulate a larger greenhouse warming over the Arctic, as well as larger increases of Arctic precipitation and decreases of Arctic sea level pressure, when greenhouse gas concentrations are increased. Because several models have substantially smaller systematic errors than the other models, the differences in greenhouse projections imply that the choice of a subset of models may offer a viable approach to narrowing the uncertainty and obtaining more robust estimates of future climate change in regions such as Alaska, Greenland, and the broader Arctic.},

abstract = {ERA-40 is a re-analysis of meteorological observations from September 1957 to August 2002 produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in collaboration with many institutions. The observing system changed considerably over this re-analysis period, with assimilable data provided by a succession of satellite-borne instruments from the 1970s onwards, supplemented by increasing numbers of observations from aircraft, ocean-buoys and other surface platforms, but with a declining number of radiosonde ascents since the late 1980s. The observations used in ERA-40 were accumulated from many sources. The first part of this paper describes the data acquisition and the principal changes in data type and coverage over the period. It also describes the data assimilation system used for ERA-40. This benefited from many of the changes introduced into operational forecasting since the mid-1990s, when the systems used for the 15-year ECMWF re-analysis (ERA-15) and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) re-analysis were implemented. Several of the improvements are discussed. General aspects of the production of the analyses are also summarized. A number of results indicative of the overall performance of the data assimilation system, and implicitly of the observing system, are presented and discussed. The comparison of background (short-range) forecasts and analyses with observations, the consistency of the global mass budget, the magnitude of differences between analysis and background fields and the accuracy of medium-range forecasts run from the ERA-40 analyses are illustrated. Several results demonstrate the marked improvement that was made to the observing system for the southern hemisphere in the 1970s, particularly towards the end of the decade. In contrast, the synoptic quality of the analysis for the northern hemisphere is sufficient to provide forecasts that remain skilful well into the medium range for all years. Two particular problems are also examined: excessive precipitation over tropical oceans and a too strong Brewer-Dobson circulation, both of which are pronounced in later years. Several other aspects of the quality of the re-analyses revealed by monitoring and validation studies are summarized. Expectations that the second-generation ERA-40 re-analysis would provide products that are better than those from the firstgeneration ERA-15 and NCEP/NCAR re-analyses are found to have been met in most cases. {\textcopyright} Royal Meteorological Society, 2005.

Results from this hindcast include traditional wave parameters, like the significant wave height and mean periods, and we particularly consider the accuracy of the results for phenomenal sea states, with significant heights above 14. m. Using unbiased winds, there is no evidence of a bias in wave heights even for this very high range. Various spectral moments were also validated, including the surface Stokes drift and mean square slopes that are relevant for wave-current interactions modelling and remote sensing, and also spectra of seismic noise sources. The estimation of these parameters is made more accurate by the new wave growth and dissipation parameterizations. Associated air-sea fluxes of momentum and energy are significantly different from what is obtained with the WAM-Cycle 4 parameterization, with a roughness that is practically a function of wind speed only. That particular output of the model does not appear very realistic and will require future adjustments of the generation and dissipation parameterizations. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Prior assessments have provided general broad scale information on the resource magnitude, but detail needed to support next level site assessments has been deficient. Aiming to support all stakeholders in Australia's emerging wave energy industry, this study presents a revised assessment of Australia's national wave energy resource. The assessment is based on a state-of-the-art global wave hindcast, with higher resolution in the Australian region. Validation of the hindcast relative to in-situ wave buoy and satellite altimeter observations show better comparison than prior assessments. The total nationally available resource is similar in magnitude to earlier studies, but regional differences are evident. The total integrated energy flux across the 200 m contour is approximately 2730 TWh/yr, with estimates of resource along the north and eastern coasts being less than previously estimated. This revised pre-competitive resource information is delivered coincidently with marine management and alternative use (constraint layers), and energy infrastructure, spatial information via the open-access Australian Wave Energy Atlas (AWavEA), served through the Australian Renewable Energy Infrastructure (AREMI).

abstract = {A new 109year numerical wind-wave hindcast is developed for the North Atlantic Ocean based on the 20th century atmospheric reanalysis (20CR). Wave results are validated directly against data originating from voluntary observing ships and satellite altimetry in the North-East Atlantic Ocean. The normalized error for yearly-mean significant wave height (Hs) is shown to be of the order of 5{\%} for the second part of the 20th century. An indirect validation is also performed through 10m wind speed and suggests that the accuracy of yearly-mean Hs only slightly decreases for the beginning of the 20th century. The comparison between Hs and the index of the North Atlantic Oscillation revealed that this phenomenon partly controls Hs inter-annual variability, with a positive (negative) correlation in the northeastern (southwestern) part of the study area. The analysis of model results shows an increase in Hs over the whole North Atlantic Ocean superimposed to the inter-annual variability, reaching 0.01m.yr-1 (20 to 40{\%} over the 20th century) north of 50??N. This increase is explained by a rise in wind speed exceeding 20{\%} north of 50??N. The roughening in the wave climate demonstrated in this study is expected to have strong implications for the development of coastal zones and could explain the increase in erosion along the North Atlantic shorelines. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Three different climate scenarios (A2, A1B and B1) for the period 2000-2099 together with a control run for 1950-2000 have been simulated forced by greenhouse gases concentrations. A hindcast run for the 20th century (1958-2001) forced with a dynamical downscaling of ERA40 reanalysis has also been performed. Comparisons between hindcast and control run show consistency on their average statistics and their spatial distribution in terms of extreme events. Results for the 21st century reveal that storm surges frequency and magnitude decrease. Changes reach 50{\%} in the number of events and up to 8. cm in the 50-year return levels. The analysis shows a progressive decrease in the return levels not fully explained by a negative trend in the mean atmospherically-induced sea level and a linear dependence with winter NAO. Likewise, negative events show the opposite behavior, with an increase in their frequency and magnitude although smaller than for positive surges. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The extreme wave climate is of paramount importance for: (i) off-shore and coastal engineering design, (ii) ship design and maritime transportation, or (iii) analysis of coastal processes. Identifying the synoptic patterns that produce extreme waves is necessary to understand the wave climate for a specific location. Thus, a characterization of these weather patterns may allow the study of the relationships between the magnitude and occurrence of extreme wave events and the climate system. The aim of this paper is to analyze the interannual variability of extreme wave heights. For this purpose, we present a methodological framework and its application to an area over the North East (NE) Atlantic Ocean. The climatology in the NE Atlantic is analyzed using the self-organizing maps (SOMs). The application of this clustering technique to monthly mean sea level pressure fields provides a continuum of synoptic categorizations compared with discrete realizations produced through most traditional methods. The extreme wave climate has been analyzed by means of monthly maxima of the significant wave height (SWH) in several locations over the NE Atlantic. A statistical approach based on a time-dependent generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution has been applied. The seasonal variation was characterized and, afterwards, the interannual variability was studied throughout regional pressure patterns. The anomalies of the 50-year return level estimates of SWH, due to interannual variability have been projected into the weather types of SOM. It provides a comprehensive visual representation, which relates the weather type with the positive or negative contribution to extreme waves over the selected locations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The performance of 24 GCMs available in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) is evaluated over the eastern Tibetan Plateau (TP) by comparing the model outputs with ground observations for the period 1961–2005. The twenty-first century trends of precipitation and temperature based on the GCMs'projections over the TP are also analyzed. The results suggest that for temperature mostGCMs reasonably capture the climatological patterns and spatial variations of the observed climate. However, the majority of the models have cold biases, with a mean underestimation of 1.18–2.58C for the months December–May, and less than 18C for June–October. For precipitation, the simulations of all models over- estimate the observations in climatological annual means by 62.0{\%}–183.0{\%},and only half of the 24GCMsare able to reproduce the observed seasonal pattern, which demonstrates a critical need to improve precipitation- related processes in these models. All models produce a warming trend in the twenty-first century under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (rcp8.5) scenario; in contrast, the rcp2.6 scenario predicts a lower average warming rate for the near term, and a small cooling trend in the long-term period with the decreasing radiative forcing. In the near term, the projected precipitation change is about 3.2{\%} higher than the 1961–2005 annual mean, whereas in the long term the precipitation is projected to increase 6.0{\%} under rcp2.6 and 12.0{\%} under the rcp8.5 scenario. Relative to the 1961–2005 mean, the annual temperature is projected to increase by 1.28–1.38Cin the short term; the warmings under the rcp2.6 and rcp8.5 scenarios are 1.88 and 4.18C, respectively, for the long term.},

A methodology has been developed to apply the aforementioned techniques to wave climate analysis, which implies data pre-processing and slight modifications in the algorithms. Results show that: a) the SOM classifies the wave climate in the relevant "wave types" projected in a bidimensional lattice, providing an easy visualization and probabilistic multidimensional analysis; b) the KMA technique correctly represents the average wave climate and can be used in several coastal applications such as longshore drift or harbor agitation; c) the MDA algorithm allows selecting a representative subset of the wave climate diversity quite suitable to be implemented in a nearshore propagation methodology. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Accurate estimates of Stokes drift are necessary to quantify Lagrangian transport and upper-ocean mixing. These can be estimated from directional wave spectra. Here, a methodology for the reconstruction of such spectra is developed using partitioned bulk wave parameters provided by global wave models. These reconstructed spectra agree well with global wave model–simulated full spectra. Regional wave model sim-ulations with reconstructed spectra as open boundary conditions lead to more accurate estimates of bulk wave parameters in the coastal ocean. Furthermore, the reconstructed directional spectra can be used to improve high-frequency (HF) radar–derived surface Lagrangian current estimates. Stokes drift vertical profiles from complete directional spectra are more accurate, and therefore coupled ocean circulation and wave models should incorporate spectral estimates for wave–current interaction studies. Based on model simulations conducted here, it is recommended that regional wave modeling studies use partitioned rather than bulk wave parameter products from global wave simulations to reconstruct complete directional spectra for open boundary conditions. Finally, this study shows that inclusion of the peak spectral energy for each partition improves the ability to reconstruct more accurately directional spectra and surface Stokes drift. It is rec-ommended that the global wave model hindcast/forecast include this additional bulk parameter.},

abstract = {A method for characterizing wave systems from temporal sequences and spatial arrays of directional ocean surface gravity-wave spectral estimates is presented. The method is structured in two major stages. In the first data-intensive stage, individual spectra are parameterized in terms of the directions, periods, and significant wave heights of wave systems represented in that spectrum. In the second stage, wave systems from spectra are associated with similar wave systems in neighboring spectra, and large-scale wave systems representing activity occurring continuously over groups of contiguous spectra are determined. This high-level description of the ocean surface wave field represents a considerable data reduction that preserves directional information in a more meaningful way than either average wave directions computed over the entire spectrum or wind sea-swell decompositions. Each large-scale wave system is normally caused by a distinct meteorological event. Data from the Labrador Sea Extreme Waves Experiment (LEWEX) are used to illustrate applications to numerical wave model and buoy spectra, and these methods should be useful in other spectral data comparison experiments. Other potential applications include the interpretation and archival of global wave-model analyses and the compression of wave spectra in a manner sufficient to preserve information necessary for numerical wave model data-assimilation schemes.},

Moreover, the debate around the global figure of available resource is still widely open. This study provides a new global wave power assessment using a dataset that covers the period from 1948 to 2008, which was corrected using altimetry data and validated with buoys in terms of wave power. This study characterizes the mean wave power globally as well as its monthly and seasonal variability. Furthermore, it provides a link with the most relevant climate indices globally. The effect of the interannual variability is especially noteworthy for the Northern Hemisphere, where the seasonality is strongest. Additionally, we detect decadal long-term changes and determine that natural variability could explain a few of the differences found between decades. Lastly, we provide an assessment of the global theoretical wave power that covers the last six decades, compare approaches and estimates, and discuss factors of discrepancy. The global offshore wave power is estimated at 32,000. TW. h/yr, which is reduced to 16,000. TW. h/yr when considering the direction of the energy. The historical average change is 580. TW. h/decade. Our results indicate that the global natural variability could be a more relevant factor in the lifetime of wave farms than the historical long-term changes in wave energy.},

abstract = {Extensive wave measurements were collected on the North Carolina–Virginia continental shelf in the autumn of 1999. Comparisons of observations and spectral refraction computations reveal strong cross-shelf decay of energetic remotely generated swell with, for one particular event, a maximum reduction in wave energy of 93{\%} near the Virginia coastline, where the shelf is widest. These dramatic energy losses were observed in light-wind conditions when dissipation in the surface boundary layer caused by wave breaking (whitecaps) was weak and wave propagation directions were onshore with little directional spreading. These observations suggest that strong dissipation of wave energy takes place in the bottom boundary layer. The inferred dissipation is weaker for smaller-amplitude swells. For the three swell events described here, observations are reproduced well by numerical model hindcasts using a parameterization of wave friction over a movable sandy bed. Directional spectra that are narrow off the shelf are observed to broaden significantly as waves propagate over the inner shelf, although refraction theory predicts a narrowing. This broadening generally agrees with predictions of Bragg scattering of random waves by the irregular seafloor topography.},

abstract = {Wave climate across the ocean basins can be described using satellite altimetry; here, we concentrate on the North Atlantic region. Waves in the North Atlantic are strongly seasonal and peak in the winter season. The northeastern sector of the Atlantic and adjoining shelf seas also exhibit exceptionally high interannual variability in the winter, with monthly average significant wave height varying by up to a factor of 2 from one year to the next. The strength and geographical distribution of variability is broadly consistent throughout the winter months (December–March). A large fraction of these wave height anomalies is associated with a single pattern of pressure anomalies that resembles the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). A predictor based on NAO dependence is “trained” from relatively recent satellite data and then tested against earlier satellite and in situ data. The predictor is successful in large areas of the North Atlantic, confirming a robust relationship between wave height anomalies and the NAO over the last few decades. A substantial rise (up to 0.6 m) in monthly mean wave heights on the northeastern Atlantic during the latter part of the twentieth century is attributable to changes in the NAO. Substantial residual anomalies in wave heights exist after the influence of the NAO has been subtracted; these are partly explained by a second pair of North Atlantic patterns in wave height anomalies and sea level pressure anomalies. This “East Atlantic” pattern is particularly influential in midwinter and affects the southern part of the northeastern sector (including the region of Seven Stones Light Vessel)},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the ability of the multi-model simulations from the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to simulate the main leading modes of variability over the Euro-Atlantic region in winter: the North-Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Scandinavian mode (SCAND), the East/Atlantic Oscillation (EA) and the East Atlantic/Western Russia mode (EA/WR). These modes of variability have been evaluated both spatially, by analyzing the intensity and location of their anomaly centres, as well as temporally, by focusing on the probability density functions and e-folding time scales. The choice of variability modes as a tool for climate model assessment can be justified by the fact that modes of variability determine local climatic conditions and their likely change may have important implications for future climate changes. It is found that all the models considered are able to simulate reasonably well these four variability modes, the SCAND being the mode which is best spatially simulated. From a temporal point of view the NAO and SCAND modes are the best simulated. UKMO-HadGEM1 and CGCM3.1(T63) are the models best at reproducing spatial characteristics, whereas CCSM3 and CGCM3.1(T63) are the best ones with regard to the temporal features. GISS-AOM is the model showing the worst performance, in terms of both spatial and temporal features. These results may bring new insight into the selection and use of specific models to simulate Euro-Atlantic climate, with some models being clearly more successful in simulating patterns of temporal and spatial variability than others.},

Over the oceans, changes in wind speed and the surface gravity waves generated by such winds play an important role. We used a 23-year database of calibrated and validated satellite altimeter measurements to investigate global changes in oceanic wind speed and wave height over this period. We find a general global trend of increasing values of wind speed and, to a lesser degree, wave height, over this period. The rate of increase is greater for extreme events as compared to the mean condition.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes the development process and main characteristics of the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), a set of four new pathways developed for the climate modeling community as a basis for long-term and near-term modeling experiments. The four RCPs together span the range of year 2100 radiative forcing values found in the open literature, i.e. from 2.6 to 8.5W/m2. The RCPs are the product of an innovative collaboration between integrated assessment modelers, climate modelers, terrestrial ecosystem modelers and emission inventory experts. The resulting product forms a comprehensive data set with high spatial and sectoral resolutions for the period extending to 2100. Land use and emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases are reported mostly at a 0.5×0.5 degree spatial resolution, with air pollutants also provided per sector (for well-mixed gases, a coarser resolution is used). The underlying integrated assessment model outputs for land use, atmospheric emissions and concentration data were harmonized across models and scenarios to ensure consistency with historical observations while preserving individual scenario trends. For most variables, the RCPs cover a wide range of the existing literature. The RCPs are supplemented with extensions (Extended Concentration Pathways, ECPs), which allow climate modeling experiments through the year 2300. The RCPs are an important development in climate research and provide a potential foundation for further research and assessment, including emissions mitigation and impact analysis.},

abstract = {ind-generated waves at the sea surface are of outstanding importance for both their practical relevance in many aspects, such as coastal erosion, protection, or safety of navigation, and for their scientific relevance in modifying fluxes at the air–sea interface. So far, long-term changes in ocean wave climate have been studied mostly from a regional perspective with global dynamical studies emerging only recently. Here a global wave climate study is presented, in which a global wave model [Wave Ocean Model (WAM)] is driven by atmospheric forcing from a global climate model (ECHAM5) for present-day and potential future climate conditions represented by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) A1B emission scenario. It is found that changes in mean and extreme wave climate toward the end of the twenty-first century are small to moderate, with the largest signals being a poleward shift in the annual mean and extreme significant wave heights in the midlatitudes of both hemispheres, more pronounced in the Southern Hemisphere and most likely associated with a corresponding shift in midlatitude storm tracks. These changes are broadly consistent with results from the few studies available so far. The projected changes in the mean wave periods, associated with the changes in the wave climate in the middle to high latitudes, are also shown, revealing a moderate increase in the equatorial eastern side of the ocean basins. This study presents a step forward toward a larger ensemble of global wave climate projections required to better assess robustness and uncertainty of potential future wave climate change.},

abstract = {Extreme sea conditions in the nearshore zone are required for coastal flood risk analysis and structural design. Many multivariate extreme value methods that have been applied in the past have been limited by assumptions relating to the dependence structure in the extremes. A conditional extremes statistical model overcomes a number of these previous limitations. To apply the method in practice, a Monte Carlo sampling procedure is required whereby large samples of synthetically generated events are simulated. The use of Monte Carlo approaches, in combination with computationally intensive physical process models, can raise significant practical challenges in terms of computation. To overcome these challenges there has been extensive research into the use of meta-models. Meta-models are approximations of computationally intensive physical process models (simulators). They are derived by fitting functions to the outputs from simulators. Due to their simplified representation they are computationally more efficient than the simulators they approximate.Here, a methodology for deriving a large Monte Carlo sample of extreme nearshore sea states is described. The methodology comprises the generation of a large sample of offshore sea conditions using the conditional extremes model. A meta-model of the wave transformation process is then constructed. A clustering algorithm is used to aid the development of the meta-model. The large sample of offshore data is then transformed through to the nearshore using the meta-model. The resulting nearshore sea states can be used for the probabilistic design of structures or flood risk analysis. The application of the methodology to a case study site on the North Coast of Spain is described. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) project is an international effort to produce a comprehensive global atmospheric circulation dataset spanning the twentieth century, assimilating only surface pressure reports and using observed monthly sea-surface temperature and sea-ice distributions as boundary conditions. It is chiefly motivated by a need to provide an observational dataset with quantified uncertainties for validations of climate model simulations of the twentieth century on all time-scales, with emphasis on the statistics of daily weather. It uses an Ensemble Kalman Filter data assimilation method with background ‘first guess' fields supplied by an ensemble of forecasts from a global numerical weather prediction model. This directly yields a global analysis every 6 hours as the most likely state of the atmosphere, and also an uncertainty estimate of that analysis. The 20CR dataset provides the first estimates of global tropospheric variability, and of the dataset's time-varying quality, from 1871 to the present at 6-hourly temporal and 2° spatial resolutions. Intercomparisons with independent radiosonde data indicate that the reanalyses are generally of high quality. The quality in the extratropical Northern Hemisphere throughout the century is similar to that of current three-day operational NWP forecasts. Intercomparisons over the second half-century of these surface-based reanalyses with other reanalyses that also make use of upper-air and satellite data are equally encouraging. It is anticipated that the 20CR dataset will be a valuable resource to the climate research community for both model validations and diagnostic studies. Some surprising results are already evident. For instance, the long-term trends of indices representing the North Atlantic Oscillation, the tropical Pacific Walker Circulation, and the Pacific–North American pattern are weak or non-existent over the full period of record. The long-term trends of zonally averaged precipitation minus evaporation also differ in character from those in climate model simulations of the twentieth century.},

Nowadays, wave reanalyses databases generated with third generation models provide useful wave climate information to complement, both in time and space, the instrumental measurements (buoys and alimetry observations). In this work, a new global wave reanalysis (GOW) from 1948 onwards is presented. GOW dataset is intended to be periodically updated and it is based on a calibration of a model hindcast with satellite altimetry data, after verification against historical data. The outliers due to tropical cyclones (not simulated due to insufficient resolution in the wind forcing) are identified and not taken into account in the process to correct the simulated wave heights with the altimeter data. The results are validated with satellite measurements in time and space. This new calibrated database represents appropriately the wave climate characteristics since 1948 and aims to be the longest and up-to-date wave dataset for global wave climate variability analysis as well as for many coastal engineering applications. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Modeling of highly advective transport is embarrassingly difficult, even in the superficially simple case of one-dimensional constant-velocity flow. In this paper, a fresh approach is taken, based on an explicit conservative control-volume formulation that makes use of a universal limiter for transient interpolation modeling of the advective transport equations. This 'ULTIMATE' conservative difference scheme is applied to unsteady, one-dimensional scalar pure advection at constant velocity, using three representative test profiles: a discontinuous step, an isolated sine-squared wave, and a semi-ellipse. The goal is to devise a single robust scheme which achieves sharp monotonic resolution of the step without corrupting the other profiles. The semi-ellipse is particularly challenging because of its combination of sudden and gradual changes in gradient. The ULTIMATE strategy can be applied to explicit conservative advection schemes of any order of accuracy. Second-order methods are shown to be unsatisfactory because of steepening and clipping typical of currently popular so-called 'high resolution' shock-capturing or TVD schemes. The ULTIMATE third-order upwind scheme is highly satisfactory for most flows of practical importance. Higher order methods give predictably better step resolution, although even-order schemes generate a (monotonic) waviness in the difficult semi-ellipse simulation. By using adaptive stencil expansion to introduce (in principle arbitrarily) higher order resolution locally in isolated regions of high curvature or high gradient, extremely accurate coarse-grid results can be obtained with very little additional cost above that of the base (third-order) scheme. ?? 1991.},

abstract = {Underestimated rainfall over Amazonia was a common problem for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) models. We investigate whether it still exists in the CMIP phase 5 (CMIP5) models and, if so, what causes these biases? Our evaluation of historical simulations shows that some models still underestimate rainfall over Amazonia. During the dry season, both con- vective and large-scale precipitation is underestimated in most models. GFDL-ESM2M and IPSL notably show more pentads with no rainfall. During the wet season, large-scale precipitation is still underestimated in most models. In the dry and transition seasons, models with more realistic moisture convergence and surface evapotranspiration gen- erally have more realistic rainfall totals. In some models, overestimates of rainfall are associated with the adjacent tropical and eastern Pacific ITCZs. However, in other models, too much surface net radiation and a resultant high Bowen ratio appears to cause underestimates of rainfall. During the transition season, low pre-seasonal latent heat, high sensible flux, and a weaker influence of cold air incursions contribute to the dry bias. About half the models can capture, but overestimate, the influences of telecon- nection. Based on a simple metric, HadGEM2-ES outper- forms other models especially for surface conditions and atmospheric circulation. GFDL-ESM2M has the strongest dry bias presumably due to its overestimate of moisture divergence, induced by overestimated ITCZs in adjacent oceans, and reinforced by positive feedbacks between reduced cloudiness, high Bowen ratio and suppression of rainfall during the dry season, and too weak incursions of extratropical disturbances during the transition season.},

abstract = {Since the release of the ETOPO1 global Earth topography model through the US NOAA in 2009, new or significantly improved topographic data sets have become available over Antarctica, Greenland and parts of the oceans. Here, we present a suite of new 1' (arc-min) models of Earth's topography, bedrock and ice-sheets constructed as a composite from up-to-date topography models: Earth2014. Our model suite relies on SRTM30 PLUS v9 bathymetry for the base layer, merged with SRTM v4.1 topography over the continents, Bedmap2 over Antarctica and the new Greenland bedrock topography (GBT v3). As such, Earth2014 provides substantially improved information of bedrock and topography over Earth's major ice sheets, and more recent bathymetric depth data over the oceans, all merged into readily usable global grids. To satisfy multiple applications of global elevation data, Earth2014 provides different representations of Earth's relief. These are grids of (1) the physical surface, (2) bedrock (Earth's relief without water and ice masses), (3) bedrock and ice (Earth without water masses), (4) ice sheet thicknesses, (5) rockequivalent topography (ice and water masses condensed to layers of rock) as mass representation. These models have been transformed into ultra-high degree spherical harmonics, yielding degree 10,800 series expansions of the Earth2014 grids as input for spectral modelling techniques. As further variants, planetary shape models were constructed, providing distances between relief points and the geocenter. The paper describes the input data sets, the development procedures applied, the resulting gridded and spectral representations of Earth2014, external validation results and possible applications.

abstract = {The energy of waves propagating through vegetation is dissipated due to the work done by the waves on the vegetation. Dalrymple et al. (1984) estimated wave dissipation by integrating the force on a cylinder over its vertical extent. This was extended by Mendez and Losada (2004) to include varying depths and the effects of wave damping due to vegetation and wave breaking for narrow-banded random waves. This paper describes the wave dissipation over a vegetation field by the implementation of the Mendez and Losada formulation in a full spectrum model SWAN, with an extension to include a vertical layer schematization for the vegetation. The present model is validated with the original equation and results from Mendez and Losada (2004). The sensitivity of the model to the shape of the frequency spectrum, directional spreading and layer schematization are investigated. The model is then applied to field measurements by using a vegetation factor. This model has the ability to calculate two-dimensional wave dissipation over a vegetation field including some important aspects such as breaking and diffraction as used in SWAN model. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {One way in which global climate model (GCM) output can be utilized to infer local impacts is through the use of synoptic climatology: creating a set of atmospheric patterns that capture the variability in the climate system, and then analyzing trends and variability in the frequency of these patterns moving into the future. In this paper, we demonstrate a new synoptic climatological technique for classifying atmospheric patterns that can be used in conjunction with GCM output data (in this case, the Community Climate System Model 3). We apply this method to 850-hPa temperature patterns over the contiguous United States to derive daily categorizations. A total of 15 clusters are created from the data set; once the mean GCM bias is removed, historical cluster frequencies in the GCM data set are not statistically different from those of the reanalysis data set. In the future, significant changes in frequency are observed across most of the transition season clusters, as they broaden in seasonality at the expense of winter clusters, some of which nearly entirely disappear. Changes are greater moving further into the future, and greater for the more carbon-intensive special report on emissions scenarios (SRES) scenarios (A1FI, A2) than the less-intensive scenario tested (B1). Diagnostics test how well the mean patterns of the reanalysis data set, GCM historical data set and the future GCM data sets resemble each other. For some clusters, mean bias between the historical and future data sets grows substantially by the end of the 21st century under the more carbon-intensive scenarios.

abstract = {A global 1?? implementation of the spectral wave model, WaveWatch III, was forced with surface winds from two atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs: ECHAM5 and CSIRO Mk3.5), dynamically downscaled to 60. km using the Cubic Conformal Atmospheric Model. Two 30-yr time slices were simulated: 1979-2009 representing current climate, and 2070-2099 representing a future climate scenario under a high greenhouse gas emission scenario (SRES A2). A further wave model simulation with forcing from the NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis for 1979-2009, using the same model settings as the climate model forced runs, serves as a benchmark hindcast to assess skill of climate-model-derived wave fields. Climate model forced wave simulations for the 1979-2009 time-slice display biases relative to the benchmark wave climate - notably an overestimation of wave generation in the Southern Ocean, which influences broad regions of the Pacific which receive these waves as swell. Wave model runs were repeated following bias-adjustment of the climate model forcing winds with the aim to reduce biases, but model skill to simulate the monthly 99th percentile of significant wave heights deteriorates severely.Projected future changes in wave climate (between 1979-2009 and 2070-2099) under the SRES A2 greenhouse gas emission scenario are relatively insensitive to whether bias-adjustment of winds has been applied. Two robust features of projected change are observed from the two climate model sets which are qualitatively consistent with previous studies: a projected increase of Southern Ocean wave generation leading to approximately 10{\%} increase in Southern Ocean mean significant wave heights (HSm), and a projected decrease in wave generation in the North Atlantic, with changes in HSm of similar magnitude.Interannual anomalies of monthly mean significant wave height, HSm, were regressed against climate indices (Southern Oscillation Index - SOI; North Atlantic Oscillation - NAO and the Southern Annular Mode - SAM) over each time-slice. Significant differences in the relationships between wave height variability and these climate indices between current and projected climates are observed. For example, a significant shift from negative to positive correlation between the NAO and HSm anomalies along the western European and north-west African coasts in the projected future climate is noted. The potential future changes in wind-wave characteristics, and the changing relationships between interannual variability of wave climate with identified climate indices, as a response to projected future climate scenarios have broad implications for a range of processes and activities in the coastal, near-and-off-shore environments. ?? 2012.},

abstract = {This paper analyses secular changes and interannual variability in the wind wave, swell, and significant wave height (SWH) characteristics over the North Atlantic and North Pacific on the basis of wind wave climatology derived from the visual wave observations of voluntary observing ship (VOS) officers. These data are available from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) collection of surface meteorological observations for 1958-2002, but require much more complicated preprocessing than standard meteorological variables such as sea level pressure, temperature, and wind. Visual VOS data allow for separate analysis of changes in wind sea and swell, as well as in significant wave height, which has been derived from wind sea and swell estimates. In both North Atlantic and North Pacific midlatitudes winter significant wave height shows a secular increase from 10 to 40 cm decade-1 during the last 45 yr. However, in the North Atlantic the patterns of trend changes for wind sea and swell are quite different from each other, showing opposite signs of changes in the northeast Atlantic. Trend patterns of wind sea, swell, and SWH in the North Pacific are more consistent with each other. Qualitatively the same conclusions hold for the analysis of interannual variability whose leading modes demonstrate noticeable differences for wind sea and swell. Statistical analysis shows that variability in wind sea is closely associated with the local wind speed, while swell changes can be driven by the variations in the cyclone counts, implying the importance of forcing frequency for the resulting changes in significant wave height. This mechanism of differences in variability patterns of wind sea and swell is likely more realistic than the northeastward propagation of swells from the regions from which the wind sea signal originates.},

abstract = {Recent developments in the physical parameterizations available in spectral wave models have already been validated, but there is little information on their relative performance especially with focus on the higher order spectral moments and wave partitions. This study concentrates on documenting their strengths and limitations using satellite measurements, buoy spectra, and a comparison between the different models. It is confirmed that all models perform well in terms of significant wave heights; however higher-order moments have larger errors. The partition wave quantities perform well in terms of direction and frequency but the magnitude and directional spread typically have larger discrepancies. The high-frequency tail is examined through the mean square slope using satellites and buoys. From this analysis it is clear that some models behave better than the others, suggesting their parameterizations match the physical processes reasonably well. However none of the models are entirely satisfactory, pointing to poorly constrained parameterizations or missing physical processes. The major space-time differences between the models are related to the swell field stressing the importance of describing its evolution. An example swell field confirms the wave heights can be notably different between model configurations while the directional distributions remain similar. It is clear that all models have difficulty in describing the directional spread. Therefore, knowledge of the source term directional distributions is paramount in improving the wave model physics in the future.},

abstract = {This paper describes development and validation of a global climatology of basic wave parameters based on the voluntary observing ship (VOS) data from the Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set collection. Climatology covers the period 1958–1997 and presents heights and periods for the wind sea, swell, and significant wave height (SWH) over the global ocean on 2° × 2° spatial resolution. Significant wave height has been derived from separate sea and swell estimates by taking square root of the sum of squares for the seas and swells propagating approximately in the same direction and assuming SWH to be equal to the higher of the two components in all other cases. Special algorithms of corrections were applied to minimize some biases, inherent in visual wave data. Particularly, we corrected overestimation of small seas, corrected underestimation of periods, and analyzed separation between sea and swell. Validation included estimation of random observational errors, observation of sampling errors, and comparison with the alternative wave data. Estimates of random observational errors show that for the majority of locations, observational uncertainties are within 20{\%} of mean values, which allows us to discuss quantitatively the produced climatology. Biases associated with inadequate sampling were quantified using the data from high-resolution WAM hindcast for the period 1979–1993. The highest sampling biases are observed in the South Ocean, where wave height may be underestimated by 1–1.5 m because of poor sampling, primarily associated with a fair weather bias of ship routing and observation. Comparison to the other VOS-based products shows in general higher SWH in our climatology, especially in the midlatitudes. However, comparison with the altimeter data shows that even for well-sampled regions, high waves are still underestimated in VOS, suggesting a ubiquitous fair weather bias. Further ways of improving VOS-based wave climatologies and possible applications are discussed.},

For this purpose, we assessed the similarity of the simulated and quasi-observed (reanalysis) probability density functions for circulation, temperature, and humidity variables at various pressure levels, which we chose from a statistical- downscaling point of view. Our main goals were to assess which GCM variables can be reliably used as predictors for downscaling, and which GCMs perform especially well over the region under study. Results showed that specific humidity is as reliably reproduced as circulation and temperature vari- ables, and that overall performance is best for the Hadley Centre's HADGEM2 model. Secondary goals were to estimate the skillful scale of the models, and to measure the added value of bias correction, a post-processing step commonly used in practice. We found that all models lack performance at the scale of individual grid boxes, indicating that they are not robustly skillful at their smallest scale. We also found that model performance generally improves after removing monthly bias. However, model errors at higher-order moments, which cannot be removed by simply correcting the bias, were common in some models.},

The method is applied to monthly long-term distribution of significant wave height in the Western Mediterranean. The calibration (transformation of the modes) is carried out using existing buoys in the area.

Drift and mixing are also functions of the surface Stokes drift Uss, volume Stokes transport TS, a wave breaking height scale Hswg, and the flux of energy from waves to ocean turbulence $\Phi$oc. Here we describe a global database of these parameters, estimated from a well-validated numerical wave model, that uses traditional forms of the wave generation and dissipation parameterizations, and covers the years 2003-2007. Compared to previous studies, the present work has the advantage of being consistent with the known physical processes that regulate the wave field and the air-sea fluxes, and also consistent with a very large number of in situ and satellite observations of wave parameters. Consequently, some of our estimates differ significantly from previous estimates. In particular, we find that the mean global integral of $\Phi$oc is 68 TW, and the yearly mean value of TS is typically 10-30{\%} of the Ekman transport, except in well-defined regions where it can reach 60{\%}. We also have refined our previous estimates of Uss by using a better treatment of the high frequency part of the wave spectrum.

The evaluation is focused on 12 regions of Australia for the daily simulation of precipitation, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature. The evaluation is based on probability density functions and a simple quantitative measure of how well each climate model can capture the observed probability density functions for each variable and each region is introduced. Across all three variables, the coupled climate models perform better than expected. Precipitation is simulated reasonably by most and very well by a small number of models, although the problem with excessive drizzle is apparent in most models. Averaged over Australia, 3 of the 14 climate models capture more than 80{\%} of the observed probability density functions for precipitation. Minimum temperature is simulated well, with 10 of the 13 climate models capturing more than 80{\%} of the observed probability density functions. Maximum temperature is also reasonably simulated with 6 of 10 climate models capturing more than 80{\%} of the observed probability density functions. An overall ranking of the climate models, for each of precipitation, maximum, and minimum temperatures, and averaged over these three variables, is presented. Those climate models that are skillful over Australia are identified, providing guidance on those climate models that should be used in impacts assessments where those impacts are based on precipitation or temperature. These results have no bearing on how well these models work elsewhere, but the methodology is potentially useful in assessing which of the many climate models should be used by impacts groups.},

abstract = {We have measured the distribution of wave energy with frequency and direction for several months, and attempted to interpret the resulting field E(f, $\theta$ , t) in terms of pertinent geophysical processes. The fluctuating pressure on the sea bottom was measured with a triangular array of sensitive transducers located 2 miles off shore from San Clemente Island, California, at a depth of 100 m. The transducer output was brought ashore by undersea cable and telemetered to the laboratory at La Jolla, California, where it was digitally recorded. The analysis by means of high-speed computers consists of two distinct steps: (i) computing the spectral matrix Sijk = Cijk + iQijk between the records xi(t) and xj(t) (i, j = 1, 2, 3) at frequency k (k = 1, 2,..., 100); Cijk, Qijk are the co- and quadrature spectra, and Siik = Ciik the ordinary power spectra of the three records; (ii) interpreting Sijk in terms of the energy spectrum in frequency and direction (or equivalently in horizontal wave-number space). The problem is discussed in some detail. The method adapted is to find the energy and direction of a point source which can best account (in the least-square sense) for Sijk; to compute the matrix Sijk ′ associated with this optimum point source; then to find the optimum point source of the 'residual matrix' Sijk - $\gamma$ Sijk ′ (we chose $\gamma$ = 0{\textperiodcentered} 1), etc, for 100 iterations, or until the residual matrix vanishes. The calculation is made independently for each frequency. The iterative point-source method is satisfactory if the incoming radiation is associated with one or two strong sources. From daily measurements over several months we obtain E(f, $\theta$ , t). The non-directional spectra, E(f, t) = ∫ E(f, $\theta$ , t) d$\theta$ are contoured, and show pronounced slanting ridges associated with the dispersive arrivals from individual storms. Their slope and intercept give the distance and time of the source, respectively; the energy density along the ridge is associated with the wind speed, the width of the ridge with the storm duration, and the variation of width with the rate at which the storm approaches the station. The distribution of energy with direction along these ridge lines give the direction of the source (after correction for local refraction), some upper limit to source aperture and an indication of its motion normal to the line-of-site. With distance, direction, time and five other source characteristics thus derived from the wave records, the sources are fairly well specified. Comparison with weather maps leads to fair agreement in most instances. From June to September most sources lie in the New Zealand-Australia-Antarctic section or in the Ross Sea. In three instances the swell was generated in the Indian Ocean near the antipole and entered the Pacific along the great circle route between New Zealand and Antarctica. By October the southern winter has come to an end and the northern hemisphere takes over as the chief region of swell generation. Antarctic pack ice may be a factor, by narrowing the 'window' between Antarctica and New Zealand or by impairing storm fetches in the Ross Sea. The northward travelling swell is further impaired by dense island groups in the South Pacific, and an attempt is made to estimate the resulting scattering. The recorded spectrum at frequencies below 0{\textperiodcentered} 05 c/s is in rough accord with what would be expected from typical storms after due allowance for geometric spreading; at higher frequencies the spectrum fails to rise in the expected manner. A resonant interaction between the swell and the trade wind sea may be responsible for back-scattering frequencies above 0{\textperiodcentered} 05 c/s. The observed widths of the beam ({\textless} 0{\textperiodcentered} 1 radian) and of the spectral peak ($\Delta$ f/f {\textless} 0{\textperiodcentered} 1) put an upper limit on forward scattering over the transmission path of 104 wavelengths, and thus place some restriction on the energy of turbulent eddies with dimensions of the order of 1 km in the shallow layers of the sea. Finally, a comparison of mean monthly wave spectra with those from individual storm permits us to estimate the absorption time of the North Pacific basin. The resultant value of 1/2 week is not inconsistent with the assumption that most of the swell energy is absorbed along the boundaries. The inferred coastal absorption is roughly in accord with what we found at San Clemente Island (beach slope 1:30): the coast line changes from a predominantly reflecting to a predominantly absorbing boundary as the frequency increases from 0{\textperiodcentered} 03 to 0{\textperiodcentered} 05 c/s.},

The archipelago creates a localized weather system that modifies the wave energy resources from the far field. We implement a nested computational grid along the major Hawaiian Islands in the global WaveWatch3 (WW3) model and utilize the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model to provide high-resolution mesoscale wind forcing over the Hawaii region. Two hindcast case studies representative of the year-round conditions provide a quantitative assessment of the regional wind and wave patterns as well as the wave energy resources along the Hawaiian Island chain. These events of approximately two weeks each have a range of wind speeds, ground swells, and wind waves for validation of the model system with satellite and buoy measurements. The results demonstrate the wave energy potential in Hawaii waters. While the episodic swell events have enormous power reaching 60 kW/m, the wind waves, augmented by the local weather, provide a consistent energy resource of 15-25 kW/m throughout the year. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

After identifying each wave component (wind-sea, young swell and mature swell) using a spectral partitioning technique, a spiral search algorithm is used to identify the different wave systems, which are a cluster of wave-components propagating from a common origin on the ocean. This spiral search algorithm is being tested on output from two different wave models: the NOAA National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) WaveWatch III and the Delft near-shore wave model SWAN (simulating wave near shore). The tracking algorithm, prototyped in Matlab, spirals once through the entire domain to identify existing wave systems. A second loop then combines neighboring wave systems initially separated by land.},

Examples are given showing that the diagram can be used to summarize the relative merits of a collection of different models or to track changes in performance of a model as it is modified. Methods are suggested for indicating on these diagrams the statistical significance of apparent differences and the degree to which observational uncertainty and unforced internal variability limit the expected agreement between model-simulated and observed behaviors.

abstract = {Despite recent advances in ocean observing arrays and satellite sensors, there remains great uncertainty in the large-scale spatial variations of upper ocean salinity on the interannual to decadal time- scales. Consonant with both broad-scale surface warming and the amplification of the global hydrological cycle, observed global multidecadal salinity changes typically have focussed on the linear response to anthropogenic forcing but not on salinity variations due to changes in the static stability and or variability due to the intrinsic ocean or internal climate processes. Here, we examine the static stability and spatiotem- poral variability of upper ocean salinity across a hierarchy of models and reanalyses. In particular, we parti- tion the variance into time bands via application of singular spectral analysis, considering sea surface salinity (SSS), the Brunt V€ ais€ a frequency (N2), and the ocean salinity stratification in terms of the stabilizing al€ effect due to the haline part of N2 over the upper 500m. We identify regions of significant coherent SSS var- iability, either intrinsic to the ocean or in response to the interannually varying atmosphere. Based on con- sistency across models (CMIP5 and forced experiments) and reanalyses, we identify the stabilizing role of salinity in the tropics—typically associated with heavy precipitation and barrier layer formation, and the role of salinity in destabilizing upper ocean stratification in the subtropical regions where large-scale density compensation typically occurs.

abstract = {The climate projections generated in ENSEMBLES describe the world and Europe experiencing tangible, measurable climate change. As the century progresses the projected climate moves increasingly farther away from its current state, so that by 2100 the climate of Europe will be very different from today. Even under a mitigation scenario, the climate of Europe during the next few decades is still calculated to depart significantly from that of the present. ENSEMBLES results show how the impacts resulting from these climate changes, including changes in climate mean, variability and extremes, affect all the systems and sectors studied. Adverse impacts increase in magnitude through time often exceeding critical system thresholds. Examples include impacts on health, water resources, agriculture, energy supply and demand, and fire and pest risks to forests. Many of these new results reinforce the conclusions of earlier studies of climate change projections and impacts. What is new about the ENSEMBLES results is that they describe in far greater detail how the climate is expected to change under standard scenarios of future emissions. They also include, for the first time, multi-model climate projections for a greenhouse gas mitigation scenario leading to emissions and temperature stabilisation in line with European policy aims. The results have been used as a basis for a set of new tools and datasets for informing potential users about present and future climate, and have been linked to new techniques for assessing the impacts of climate change in Europe in terms of risk. This added value in the ENSEMBLES results comes from using improved models, developing new and better techniques to analyse and disseminate projections of climate change and their uncertainties, and demonstrating how this information can be applied in policy-relevant impact assessments. The improvements for example, add skill to seasonal forecasting while multi-decadal models, for the first time, have produced probabilistic climate change projections for Europe.},

abstract = {A method is described for measuring and examining ocean waves in a way which allows their amplitude and period to be determined with some precision. Data obtained in this way are compared with meteorological charts of the ocean in an attempt to assess the velocity of propagation of swell over long distances. A critical estimate is only possible when the meteorological conditions are sufficiently simple, but in one selected example it appears that the velocity of propagation is within 5{\%} of the value prescribed by hydrodynamical theory. The evidence in more complicated instances does not disagree with this result, but does not permit of such an exact interpretation. The waves are measured by the fluctuating pressure which they produce upon an instrument laid on the sea bed in shallow water near the coast. The resulting curves are examined by a machine which draws the frequency spectrum of the recorded waves. The information given by these spectra is combined with the information of wind strength given by the meteorological charts to form a 'propagation diagram' whose appearance is a test of the validity of the theoretical group velocity. A suitable theoretical basis is given to the work. Three examples are discussed in detail: a depression in the North Atlantic, a tropical storm off the coast of Florida and a train of swell which appears to have originated in a storm off Cape Horn. The swell in these examples had travelled to Land's End distances of 1200, 2800 and 6000 miles respectively. The paper deals only with the velocity of propagation of the swell and does not discuss how the amplitude of the swell may depend upon the distance the swell has travelled or the wind strength and fetch in the generating area.},

These tools collectively form the Wave Identification and Tracking System (WITS) and have been assembled entirely within the Matlab programming environment. A series of directional wave spectra, with supporting wind observations, is the only required input. Wave spectrum peaks representing specific wind sea and swell wave systems are extracted based on topographic minima, with wind sea peaks identified by wave age criteria. A swell tracking algorithm, combined with linear wave theory, provides a unique approach to storm source identification using the assimilated wave system statistics. The nature of the partitioned spectra allows the continuous, automated identification and tracking of multiple swell generation areas over space and time. Over a 6-day wave record in the Gulf of Alaska, 44 specific swell systems are identified, with up to three systems coexisting at any given time. The presence of atmospheric disturbances on surface weather charts validated the storm source predictions for more than 85{\%} of these systems. The results are synthesized to depict the wave evolution history over the duration of the observations.},

abstract = {Satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations can provide a global view of ocean swell fields when using a specific “wave mode” sampling. A methodology is presented to routinely derive integral properties of the longer-wavelength (swell) portion of the wave spectrum from SAR level 2 products and both monitor and predict their evolution across ocean basins. SAR-derived estimates of swell height and energy-weighted peak period and direction are validated against buoy observations, and the peak directions are used to project the peak periods in one dimension along the corresponding great circle route, both forward and back in time, using the peak period group velocity. The resulting real-time data set of great circle-projected peak periods produces two-dimensional maps that can be used to monitor and predict the spatial extent and temporal evolution of individual ocean swell fields as they propagate from their source region to distant coastlines. The result is found to be consistent with the dispersive arrival of peak swell periods at a midocean buoy. The simple great circle propagation method cannot project the swell heights in space like the peak periods, because energy evolution along a great circle is a function of the source storm characteristics and the unknown swell dissipation rate. A more general geometric optics model is thus proposed for the far field of the storms. This model is applied here to determine the attenuation over long distances. For one of the largest recorded storms, observations of 15 s period swells are consistent with a constant dissipation rate that corresponds to a 3300 km e-folding scale for the energy. In this case, swell dissipation is a significant term in the wave energy balance at global scales.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2017. American Geophysical Union. This paper demonstrates two important aspects of regional dynamical downscaling of multidecadal atmospheric reanalysis. First, that in this way skillful regional descriptions of multidecadal climate variability may be constructed in regions with little or no local data. Second, that the concept of large-scale constraining allows global downscaling, so that global reanalyses may be completed by additions of consistent detail in all regions of the world. Global reanalyses suffer from inhomogeneities. However, their large-scale componenst are mostly homogeneous; Therefore, the concept of downscaling may be applied to homogeneously complement the large-scale state of the reanalyses with regional detail-wherever the condition of homogeneity of the description of large scales is fulfilled. Technically, this can be done by dynamical downscaling using a regional or global climate model, which's large scales are constrained by spectral nudging. This approach has been developed and tested for the region of Europe, and a skillful representation of regional weather risks-in particular marine risks-was identified. We have run this system in regions with reduced or absent local data coverage, such as Central Siberia, the Bohai and Yellow Sea, Southwestern Africa, and the South Atlantic. Also, a global simulation was computed, which adds regional features to prescribed global dynamics. Our cases demonstrate that spatially detailed reconstructions of the climate state and its change in the recent three to six decades add useful supplementary information to existing observational data for midlatitude and subtropical regions of the world.},

abstract = {This paper examines the impacts of increasing horizontal resolution on the performance of mesoscale numerical weather prediction models. A review of previous studies suggests that decreasing grid spacing to approximately 10 km orless generally produces more realistic mesoscale structures, with particular benefits for orographically and diurnally driven flows. There have been only a few long-term objective verification studies of highresolution forecasts, and these studies suggest, perhaps deceptively, that there are diminishing returns as horizontal grid spacing decreases below approximately 10 km. A multiyear objective verification of the University of Washington MM5 real-time forecastingsystem compares the realism of predicted surface parameters at 36-, 12-, and 4-km grid spacing over western Washington state for periods up to 48 h. Traditional verification statistics (such as mean absolute, bias, and root-meansquareerror) are calculated by interpolating model forecasts to the observation sites. For precipitation, it is shown that model skill over western Washington improves as grid spacing decreases from 36 to 12 km. Verification scores generally degrade as resolution is increased from 12 to 4 km as overprediction develops over the windward slopes and the crestsof terrain. However, for heavy precipitation amounts on windward slopes, the transition from 12 to 4 km does appear to enhance forecast accuracy. Temperature and wind statistics indicate noticeably improved skill as horizontal resolutiondecreases from 36 to 12 km, while only minor increases in skill are evident as grid spacing decreasesto 4 km. In contrast, verification of sea level pressure suggests little improvement as resolution is increased. The benefits of resolution are not uniform over the 4-km domain. For all parameters, the region downwind of a major barrier barrier—the Olympic Mountains—enjoys the largest enhancement of forecast skill as resolution is increased from 36 to 12 km, with noticeable, but lesser, improvements as grid spacing decreases to 4 km. Filtering the verification times to consider only periods with relatively good synoptic-scale forecasts provides only modest forecastimprovement. A case study illustrates that decreasing grid spacing to 4 km produces more realistic mesoscalestructures and amplitudes, a fact that is not revealed by traditional verification approaches because asmall timing error existed. The paper ends by examining the benefits of resolution, some pitfalls associatedwith traditional verification approaches, and suggests future directions for numerical weather prediction and mesoscaleverification. It is argued that higher resolution might be more beneficial than simple skill scores and that new mesoscale verification approaches must be crafted.},

A high horizontal resolution of 2km is used to provide an accurate representation of the terrain features.

Each pattern contains a high number of days which allows one to reach solid conclusions regarding the model performance. The accuracy of the simulations to reproduce the wind field under representative synoptic situations, or pressure patterns (PPs), of the Iberian Peninsula is also inspected in order to diagnose errors as a function of the large-scale situation. The evaluation is accomplished using daily averages in order to inspect the ability of WRF to reproduce the surface flow as a result of the interaction between the synoptic scale and the regional topography.

abstract = {Atmospheric reanalyses covering the European region are mainly available as part of relatively coarse global reanalyses. The aim of this article is to present the development and evaluation of a next generation regional reanalysis for the European CORDEX EUR-11 domain with a horizontal grid spacing of approximately 6 km. In this context, a reanalysis is understood to be an assimilation of heterogeneous observations with a physical model such as a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. The reanalysis system presented here is based on the NWP model COSMO by the German Meteorological Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst) using a continuous nudging scheme. In order to assess the added value of data assimilation, a dynamical downscaling experiment has been conducted, i.e. an identical model set-up but without data assimilation. Both systems have been evaluated for a 1 year test period, employing standard measures such as analysis increments, biases, or log-odds ratios, as well as tests for distributional characteristics. An important aspect is the evaluation from different perspectives and with independent measurements such as satellite infrared brightness temperatures using forward operators, integrated water vapour from GPS stations, and ceilometer cloud cover. It can be shown that the reanalysis better resolves local extreme events; this is basically an effect of the higher spatio-temporal resolution, as known from dynamical downscaling approaches. However, an important criterion for regional reanalyses is the coherence with independent observations of high temporal and spatial resolution, resulting in significant improvement over dynamical downscaling. The system is intended to become operational within a year, continuously reprocessing and evaluating longer time periods. The reanalysis data are planned to become available to the research community within a year.},

abstract = {With a rapidly increasing fraction of electricity generation being sourced from wind, extreme wind power generation events such as prolonged periods of low (or high) generation and ramps in generation, are a growing concern for the efficient and secure operation of national power systems. As extreme events occur infrequently, long and reliable meteorological records are required to accurately estimate their characteristics. Recent publications have begun to investigate the use of global meteorological "reanalysis" data sets for power system applications, many of which focus on long-term average statistics such as monthly-mean generation. Here we demonstrate that reanalysis data can also be used to estimate the frequency of relatively short-lived extreme events (including ramping on sub-daily time scales). Verification against 328 surface observation stations across the United Kingdom suggests that near-surface wind variability over spatiotemporal scales greater than around 300 km and 6 h can be faithfully reproduced using reanalysis, with no need for costly dynamical downscaling. A case study is presented in which a state-of-the-art, 33 year reanalysis data set (MERRA, from NASA-GMAO), is used to construct an hourly time series of nationally-aggregated wind power generation in Great Britain (GB), assuming a fixed, modern distribution of wind farms. The resultant generation estimates are highly correlated with recorded data from National Grid in the recent period, both for instantaneous hourly values and for variability over time intervals greater than around 6 h. This 33 year time series is then used to quantify the frequency with which different extreme GB-wide wind power generation events occur, as well as their seasonal and inter-annual variability. Several novel insights into the nature of extreme wind power generation events are described, including (i) that the number of prolonged low or high generation events is well approximated by a Poission-like random process, and (ii) whilst in general there is large seasonal variability, the magnitude of the most extreme ramps is similar in both summer and winter. An up-to-date version of the GB case study data as well as the underlying model are freely available for download from our website: http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/energymet/data/Cannon2014/.},

The CFSR was designed and executed as a global, high-resolution coupled atmosphere–ocean–land surface–sea ice system to provide the best estimate of the state of these coupled domains over this period. The current CFSR will be extended as an operational, real-time product into the future. New features of the CFSR include 1) coupling of the atmosphere and ocean during the generation of the 6-h guess field, 2) an interactive sea ice model, and 3) assimilation of satellite radiances by the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) scheme over the entire period.

abstract = {In the current work we present six hindcast WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting model) simulations for the EURO-CORDEX (European Coordinated Regional Cli-mate Downscaling Experiment) domain with different con-figurations in microphysics, convection and radiation for the time period 1990–2008. All regional model simulations are forced by the ERA-Interim reanalysis and have the same spatial resolution (0.44 •). These simulations are evaluated for surface temperature, precipitation, short-and longwave downward radiation at the surface and total cloud cover. The analysis of the WRF ensemble indicates systematic tem-perature and precipitation biases, which are linked to dif-ferent physical mechanisms in the summer and winter sea-sons. Overestimation of total cloud cover and underestima-tion of downward shortwave radiation at the surface, mostly linked to the Grell–Devenyi convection and CAM (Commu-nity Atmosphere Model) radiation schemes, intensifies the negative bias in summer temperatures over northern Europe (max −2.5 • C). Conversely, a strong positive bias in down-ward shortwave radiation in summer over central (40–60 {\%}) and southern Europe mitigates the systematic cold bias over these regions, signifying a typical case of error compensa-tion. Maximum winter cold biases are over northeastern Eu-rope (−2.8 • C); this location suggests that land–atmosphere rather than cloud–radiation interactions are to blame. Precip-itation is overestimated in summer by all model configura-tions, especially the higher quantiles which are associated with summertime deep cumulus convection. The largest pre-cipitation biases are produced by the Kain–Fritsch convec-tion scheme over the Mediterranean. Precipitation biases in winter are lower than those for summer in all model con-figurations (15–30 {\%}). The results of this study indicate the importance of evaluating not only the basic climatic param-eters of interest for climate change applications (temperature and precipitation), but also other components of the energy and water cycle, in order to identify the sources of system-Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union. 604 E.

abstract = {EURO-CORDEX is an international climate downscaling initiative that aims to provide high-resolution climate scenarios for Europe. Here an evaluation of the ERA-Interim-driven EURO-CORDEX regional climate model (RCM) ensemble is presented. The study documents the per-formance of the individual models in representing the basic spatiotemporal patterns of the European climate for the pe-riod 1989–2008. Model evaluation focuses on near-surface air temperature and precipitation, and uses the E-OBS data set as observational reference. The ensemble consists of 17 simulations carried out by seven different models at grid resolutions of 12 km (nine experiments) and 50 km (eight experiments). Several performance metrics computed from monthly and seasonal mean values are used to assess model performance over eight subdomains of the European conti-nent. Results are compared to those for the ERA40-driven ENSEMBLES simulations. The analysis confirms the ability of RCMs to capture the basic features of the European climate, including its vari-ability in space and time. But it also identifies nonnegligible deficiencies of the simulations for selected metrics, regions and seasons. Seasonally and regionally averaged tempera-ture biases are mostly smaller than 1.5 • C, while precipita-tion biases are typically located in the ±40 {\%} range. Some bias characteristics, such as a predominant cold and wet bias in most seasons and over most parts of Europe and a warm and dry summer bias over southern and southeastern Europe reflect common model biases. For seasonal mean quantities averaged over large European subdomains, no clear bene-fit of an increased spatial resolution (12 vs. 50 km) can be identified. The bias ranges of the EURO-CORDEX ensem-ble mostly correspond to those of the ENSEMBLES simula-tions, but some improvements in model performance can be identified (e.g., a less pronounced southern European warm summer bias).

abstract = {The authors address a particular example of the general question of whether high-resolution forecasts provide additional deterministic skill beyond what can be achieved with a coarser-resolution model. To this end, real-time forecasts using the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University–NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) with grid increments of 30 and 3.3 km are compared over a domain centered on the complex terrain region of southern New Mexico during the 1 June 2002 to 1 June 2003 period. The authors use time series of surface data to evaluate the relative ability of the two forecasts to capture significant temporal variations of wind. The authors hypothesize that the additional detail and structure provided by high resolution becomes a “liability” when the forecasts are scored by traditional verification metrics, because such metrics sharply penalize forecasts with small temporal or spatial errors of predicted features. Thus, a set of verification metrics is designed that is increasingly tolerant of timing errors for temporal changes of wind. The authors find that the barrier-normal (i.e., zonal) wind component over complex terrain reveals the greatest improvement in skill due to increased horizontal resolution for the cases considered here. In addition, the fine-grid forecasts better replicate the cessation of drainage flow or onset of upslope flow near and within complex terrain. The most surprising result is the marginal benefit of the higher resolution over valley locations not in immediate proximity to the mountain slopes, even though the valley is only about 60 km across (east–west). Overall, the gains in forecast accuracy from finer grid spacing are generally incremental, but increase with greater tolerance for timing errors, culminating in the greatest improvement for forecasts of temporal variance.},

abstract = {The goal of this study is to develop a high- resolution atmospheric hindcast over the Mediterranean area using the WRF-ARW model, focusing on offshore surface wind fields. In order to choose the most adequate model configuration, the study provides details on the calibration of the experimental saet-up through a sensitivity test considering the October–December 2001 period (the 2001 super-storm event in the West Mediterranean). A daily forecast outperforms the spectral technique of pre- vious products and the boundary data from ERA-Interim reanalysis produces the most accurate estimates in terms of wind variability and hour-to-hour correspondence. According to the sensitivity test, two data sets of wind hindcast are produced: the SeaWind I (30-km horizontal resolution for a period of 60 years) and the SeaWind II (15- km horizontal resolution for 20 years). The validation of the resulting surface winds is undertaken considering two offshore observational datasets. On the one hand, hourly surface buoy stations are used to validate wind time series at specific locations; on the other hand, wind altimeter satellite observations are considered for spatial validation in the whole Mediterranean Sea. The results obtained from this validation process show a very good agreement with observations for the southern Europe region. Finally, SeaWind I and II are used to characterize offshore wind fields in the Mediterranean Sea. The statistical structure of sea surface wind is analyzed and the agreement with Weibull probability distribution is discussed. In addition, wind persistence and extreme wind speed (50 year return period) are characterized and relevant areas of wind power generation are described by estimating wind energy quantities.},

abstract = {Large offshore wind energy projects are being planned and installed in the North Sea, and there is an urgent demand for high-resolution atmospheric statistics to assess potential power production and revenue. Meteorological observations are too sparse to obtain those statistics, and global reanalyses like ERA-Interim have a resolution too coarse in space and time to capture important small-scale and terrain-driven features of the atmospheric flow. We therefore dynamically downscale ERA-Interim with the mesoscale model Weather Research and Forecasting to a 3 km grid to capture those unresolved features, for the period 1999–2008. The large-scale flow is conditioned by spectral nudging, and we make use of observation nudging towards QuikSCAT near-surface winds. The downscaling results in 100m wind-speed distributions and mean wind speeds, which are closer to the observations than ERA-Interim, while the accuracy in terms of root-mean-square error decreases. The observation nudging partially counteracts this latter effect, improving the root-mean-square error of wind speed and direction by 0.5ms1 and {\~{}}10°, respectively. We also introduce the power skill score, specifically designed to evaluate model performance within wind resource mapping. The power skill score confirms that the dynamical downscaling improves the distribution of wind speed in ranges where high accuracy is important for wind resource assessment.},

Co-location criteria are within 0.1 degrees and 0.06 degrees in longitudinal and latitudinal distance from RCM grid points and within 10 min. In the wind speed range, QuikSCAT L2B12 is reliably reproducing (3-20 m s(-1)), dynamically downscaled wind speed does not show an added value in 'open ocean' areas. However, in coastal areas with complex topography, the regional models show an added value, especially around Iceland and the Iberian Peninsula and in the Mediterranean, Baltic and Irish Seas, validating the findings of previous in situ data-based studies on the added value. Strong interseasonal differences exist, in winter enhanced cyclonic and meso-cyclonic activity increases the potential of dynamical downscaling. In winter time, the added value is more pronounced around Iceland and Greenland, south of Iceland and within the Gulf of Lyon/Mistral region. Summarizing the presented method can be easily applied for other ocean areas, making QuikSCAT a valuable tool to identify marine regions where dynamical downscaling adds value to surface marine wind speed. A detailed comparison of 10 m winds from the National Centres of Environmental Prediction (NCEP)/National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and the newer NCEP/DOE-II reanalyses is presented in the annex, motivating the use of the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis in the added value assessment.

While there are excellent reanalysis data sets available to support historical studies, researchers are usually faced with using a data set which has insufficient horizontal resolution for New Zealand's complex topography, or if the resolution is sufficient then the history of the data may be too limited. MetOcean Solutions Ltd (MSL) has completed a 33-year high resolution hindcast over New Zealand in order to support research into New Zealand's marine environment. The hindcast covers the period January 1979 to the present and has a time resolution of 1 hour. The horizontal resolution is 12km over New Zealand and 4km over two nests of particular interest. Full 3-dimensional data has been archived over New Zealand and this paper aims to describe the data and its construction as well as offering some validation.},

abstract = {The use of hindcast climatic data is quite extended for multiple applications. However, this approach needs the support of a validation process to allow its drawbacks and, therefore, confidence levels to be assessed. In this work, the strategy relies on an hourly wind database resulting from a dynamical downscaling experiment, with a spatial resolution of 10 km, covering the Iberian Peninsula (IP), driven by the ERA40 reanalysis (1959-2001) extended by European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) analysis (2002-2007) and comprising two main steps. Initially, the skill of the simulation is evaluated comparing the quality-tested observational database (Lorente-Plazas et al., 2014) at local and regional scales. The results show that the model is able to portray the main features of the wind over the IP: annual cycles, wind roses, spatial and temporal variability, as well as the response to different circulation types. In addition, there is a significant added value of the simulation with respect to driving conditions, especially in regions with a complex orography. However, some problems are evident, the major drawback being the systematic overestimation of the wind speed, which is mainly attributed to a missrepresentation of frictional forces. The model skill is also lower along the Mediterranean coast and for the Pyrenees. In a second phase, the high spatio-temporal resolution of the pseudo-real wind database is used to explore the limitations of the observational database. It is shown that missing values do not affect the characterisation of the wind climate over the IP, while the length of the observational period (6 years) is sufficient for most regions, with only a few exceptions. The spatial distribution of the observational sampling schemes should be enhanced to improve the correct assessment of all IP wind regimes, particularly in some mountainous areas.},

abstract = {The value restored and added by dynamical downscaling is quantitatively evaluated by considering the spectral behavior of the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) in relation to its domain size and grid spacing. A regional climate model (RCM) simulation is compared with NCEP Reanalysis data regridded to the RAMS grid at each model analysis time for a set of six basic experiments. At large scales, RAMS underestimates atmospheric variability as determined by the column integrated kinetic energy and integrated moisture flux convergence. As the grid spacing increases or domain size increases, the underestimation of atmospheric variability at large scales worsens. The model simulated evolution of the kinetic energy relative to the reanalysis regridded kinetic energy exhibits a decrease with time, which is more pronounced with larger grid spacing. Additional follow-on experiments confirm that the surface boundary forcing is the dominant factor in generating atmospheric variability for small-scale features and that it exerts greater control on the RCM solution as the influence of lateral boundary conditions diminish. The sensitivity to surface forcing is also influenced by the model parameterizations, as demonstrated by using a different convection scheme. For the particular case considered, dynamical downscaling with RAMS in RCM mode does not retain value of the large scale which exists in the larger global reanalysis. The utility of the RCM, or value added, is to resolve the smaller-scale features which have a greater dependence on the surface boundary. This conclusion regarding RAMS is expected to be true for other RCMs as well.},

abstract = {Hindcasts with reanalysis-driven regional climate models (RCMs) are a common tool to assess weather statistics (i.e., climate) and recent changes and trends. The capability of different state-of-the-art RCMs (with and without spectral nudging applied) to add value for surface marine wind speed in comparison to the reanalysis wind speed forcing is assessed by the comparison with observations in the eastern North Atlantic in 1998. Added value is elaborated on instantaneous wind speeds and their frequency distribution. The observations are discriminated into groups according to their proximity to land and assimilation status, meaning whether they are assimilated into the reanalysis or not. For instantaneous wind speeds RCMs do not show added value both in "open ocean'' areas and the German Bight. However, in the English Channel, where local topography and associated local wind regimes become important, the regional models show an added value for instantaneous wind speeds. Concerning the wind speed distribution there is a clear indication for an added value of the RCMs in coastal regions, especially for higher wind speed percentiles, while in open-ocean areas no added value is found. In comparison to the unnudged simulation, the spectrally nudged simulations better represent both instantaneous wind speeds and their frequency distribution. These results hold independently of the measurements' assimilation status. Strictly the findings of this study only hold for hindcast studies, the results may differ for other areas and years.},

Then we have explored how the quality of the surface wind and wave model results varies with the resolution. The comparisons have been done in the oceans and in the Mediterranean Sea, using measured data from buoys and satellite. At the highest resolution we have used, T799 or 25km, the biases in the oceans reduce to very small values of the order of a few percent. In enclosed seas, represented in this case by the Mediterranean, the errors decrease with increasing resolution, but a substantial underestimate still remains. The maximum values of both the wind speeds and the wave heights increase with resolution. However, the suggestion is that even T799 fails to model properly the highest peaks of the storms, a fact possibly due to the inaccurate description of physics in these extreme events. This seems particularly true in the case of a cyclone in the Bay of Bengal.},

abstract = {The results of numerically modeled wind speed climate, a primary component of wind energy resource assessment in the complex terrain of Croatia, are given. For that purpose, dynamical downscaling of 10 yr (1992-2001) of the 40-yrECMWFRe-Analysis (ERA-40) was performed to 8-km horizontal grid spacing with the use of a spectral, prognostic full-physics model Aire Limitee Adaptation Dynamique Developpement International (ALADIN; the "ALHR" version). Then modeled data with a 60-min frequency were refined to 2-km horizontal grid spacing with a simplified and cost-effective model version, the so-called dynamical adaptation (DADA). The statistical verification of ERA-40-, ALHR-, and DADA-modeled wind speed on the basis of data from measurement stations representing different regions of Croatia suggests that downscaling was successful and that model accuracy generally improves as horizontal resolution is increased. The areas of the highest mean wind speeds correspond well to locations of frequent and strong bora flow as well as to the prominent mountain peaks. The best results are achieved with DADA and contain bias of 1{\%} of the mean wind speed for eastern Croatia while reaching 10{\%} for complex coastal terrain, mainly because of underestimation of the strongest winds. Root-mean-square errors for DADA are significantly smaller for flat terrain than for complex terrain, with relative values close to 12{\%} of the mean wind speed regardless of the station location. Spectral analyses suggest that the shape of the kinetic energy spectra generally relaxes from k(-3) at the upper troposphere to the shape of orographic spectra near the surface and shows no seasonal variability. Apart from the buildup of energy on smaller scales of motions, it is shown that mesoscale simulations contain a considerable amount of energy related to near-surface and mostly divergent meso-beta-scale (20-200 km) motions. Spectral decomposition of measured and modeled data in temporal space indicates a reasonable performance of all model datasets in simulating the primary maximum of spectral power related to synoptic and larger-than-diurnal mesoscale motions, with somewhat increased accuracy of mesoscale model data. The primary improvement of dynamical adaptation was achieved for cross-mountain winds, whereas mixed results were found for along-mountain wind directions. Secondary diurnal and tertiary semidiurnal maxima are significantly better simulated with the mesoscale model for coastal stations but are somewhat more erroneous for the continental station. The mesoscale model data underestimate the spectral power of motions with less-than-semidiurnal periods.},

During the downscaling process, however, the simulation of regional climate models (RCMs) tends to drift away from the driving fields. Developing a solution that addresses this issue, by retaining the large scale features (from the large-scale fields) and the small-scale features (from the RCMs) has led to the development of "nudging" techniques. Here, we examine the performance of two nudging techniques, grid and spectral nudging, in the downscaling of NCEP/NCAR data with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. The simulations are compared against the results with North America Regional Reanalysis (NARR) data set at different scales of interest using the concept of similarity. We show that with the appropriate choice of wave numbers, spectral nudging outperforms grid nudging in the capacity of balancing the performance of simulation at the large and small scales.},

abstract = {Evaluation of model skill in predicting winds over the ocean was performed by comparing retrospective runs of numerical weather prediction (NWP) forecast models to shipborne Doppler lidar measurements in the Gulf of Maine, a potential region for U.S. coastal wind farm development. Deployed on board the NOAA R/V Ronald H. Brown during a 2004 field campaign, the high-resolution Doppler lidar (HRDL) provided accurate motion-compensated wind measurements from the water surface up through several hundred meters of the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL). The quality and resolution of the HRDL data allow detailed analysis of wind flow at heights within the rotor layer of modern wind turbines and data on other critical variables to be obtained, such as wind speed and direction shear, turbulence, low-level jet properties, ramp events, and many other wind-energy-relevant aspects of the flow. This study will focus on the quantitative validation of NWP models' wind forecasts within the lower MABL by comparison with HRDL measurements. Validation of two modeling systems rerun in special configurations for these 2004 cases—the hourly updated Rapid Refresh (RAP) system and a special hourly updated version of the North American Mesoscale Forecast System [NAM Rapid Refresh (NAMRR)]—are presented. These models were run at both normal-resolution (RAP, 13 km; NAMRR, 12 km) and high-resolution versions: the NAMRR-CONUS-nest (4 km) and the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR, 3 km). Each model was run twice: with (experimental runs) and without (control runs) assimilation of data from 11 wind profiling radars located along the U.S. East Coast. The impact of the additional assimilation of the 11 profilers was estimated by comparing HRDL data to modeled winds from both runs. The results obtained demonstrate the importance of high-resolution lidar measurements to validate NWP models and to better understand what atmospheric conditions may impact the accuracy of wind forecasts in the marine atmospheric boundary layer. Results of this research will also provide a first guess as to the uncertainties of wind resource assessment using NWP models in one of the U.S. offshore areas projected for wind plant development.},

abstract = {This paper describes an application of MOHID modelling system to a shallow temperate coastal lagoon in Portugal's western coast (Ria de Aveiro), simulating more than one primary producer, for a better understanding of the existing ecological dynamics and creating a useful tool to delineate land activities management practices. MOHID water quality model is driven by a physical transport model and simulates the dynamics and productivity of the two main primary producers (phytoplankton and macroalgae) as well as the cycling of nitrogen, carbon and oxygen in interaction with sediment and hydrodynamics. The integrated model is forced by exchanges with the Atlantic Ocean (tide), atmosphere, and by sediment and nutrient inputs from the upstream rivers and other discharges. Focus is given to the light parameterization of primary production, influence of hydro and sediment dynamics and to the prediction of seaweed beds distribution. The results obtained show that the model is better adjusted to field data with macroalgae's simulation and that macroalgae can have an important role in primary production. Hydrodynamic conditions can be significant in the competition between the two primary producers, determining the predominant groups as well as their limiting factors. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, it underlies a number of tailored systems that address Earth system modeling beyond weather. While the WRF Model has a centralized support effort, it has become a truly community model, driven by the developments and contributions of an active worldwide user base. The WRF Model sees significant use for operational forecasting, and its research implementations are pushing the boundaries of finescale atmospheric simulation.

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley  {\&}  Sons, Ltd. Collisions of birds, especially endangered species, with wind turbines is a major environmental concern. Automatic bird monitoring can be of aid in resolving the issue, particularly in environmental risk assessments and real-time collision avoidance. For automatic recognition of birds in images, a clean, detailed, and realistic dataset to learn features and classifiers is crucial for any machine-learning-based method. Here, we constructed a bird image dataset that is derived from the actual environment of a wind farm and that is useful for examining realistic challenges in bird recognition in practice. It consists of high-resolution images covering a wide monitoring area around a turbine. The birds captured in these images are at relatively low resolution and are hierarchically labeled by experts for fine-grained species classification. We conducted evaluations of state-of-the-art image recognition methods by using this dataset. The evaluations revealed that a deep-learning-based method and a simpler traditional learning method were almost equally successful at detection, while the former captures more generalized features. The most promising results were provided by the deep-learning-based method in classification. The best methods in our experiments recorded a 0.98 true positive rate for bird detection at a false positive rate of 0.05 and a 0.85 true positive rate for species classification at a false positive rate of 0.1.},

abstract = {The present paper describes MOHID River Network (MRN), a 1D hydrodynamic model for river networks as part of MOHID Water Modelling System, which is a modular system for the simulation of water bodies (hydrodynamics and water constituents). MRN is capable of simulating water quality in the aquatic and benthic phase and its development was especially focused on the reproduction of processes occurring in temporary river networks (flush events, pools formation, and transmission losses). Further, unlike many other models, it allows the quantification of settled materials at the channel bed also over periods when the river falls dry. These features are very important to secure mass conservation in highly varying flows of temporary rivers. The water quality models existing in MOHID are base on well-known ecological models, such as WASP and ERSEM, the latter allowing explicit parameterization of C, N, P, Si, and O cycles. MRN can be coupled to the basin model, MOHID Land, with computes runoff and porous media transport, allowing for the dynamic exchange of water and materials between the river and surroundings, or it can be used as a standalone model, receiving discharges at any specified nodes (ASCII files of time series with arbitrary time step). These features account for spatial gradients in precipitation which can be significant in Mediterranean-like basins. An interface has been already developed for SWAT basin model. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A new wind farm parameterization has been developed for the mesoscale numerical weather prediction model, the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF). The effects of wind turbines are represented by imposing a momentumsink on the mean flow; transferring kinetic energy into electricity and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). The parameterization improves upon previous models, basing the atmospheric drag of turbines on the thrust coefficient of a modern commercial turbine. In addition, the source of TKE varies with wind speed, reflecting the amount of energy extracted from the atmosphere by the turbines that does not produce electrical energy. Analyses of idealized simulations of a large offshore wind farm are presented to highlight the perturbation induced by the wind farm and its interaction with the atmospheric boundary layer (BL). A wind speed deficit extended throughout the depth of the neutral boundary layer, above and downstream from the farm, with a long wake of 60-km e-folding distance. Within the farm the wind speed deficit reached a maximumreduction of 16{\%}. A maximum increase of TKE, by nearly a factor of 7, was located within the farm. The increase in TKE extended to the top of the BL above the farm due to vertical transport and wind shear, significantly enhancing turbulent momentum fluxes. The TKE increased by a factor of 2 near the surface within the farm. Near-surface winds accelerated by up to 11{\%}. These results are consistent with the few results available from observations and large-eddy simulations, indicating this parameterization provides a reasonable means of exploring potential downwind impacts of large wind farms. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {The performance of an advanced research version of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) in predicting near-surface atmospheric temperature and wind conditions under various terrain and weather regimes is examined. Verification of 2-m temperature and 10-m wind speed and direction against surface Mesonet observations is conducted. Three individual events under strong synoptic forcings (i.e., a frontal system, a low-level jet, and a persistent inversion) are first evaluated. It is found that the WRF model is able to reproduce these weather phenomena reasonably well. Forecasts of near-surface variables in flat terrain generally agree well with observations, but errors also occur, depending on the predictability of the lower-atmospheric boundary layer. In complex terrain, forecasts not only suffer from the model's inability to reproduce accurate atmospheric conditions in the lower atmosphere but also struggle with representative issues due to mismatches between the model and the actual terrain. In addition, surface forecasts at finer resolutions do not always outperform those at coarser resolutions. Increasing the vertical resolution may not help predict the near-surface variables, although it does improve the forecasts of the structure of mesoscale weather phenomena. A statistical analysis is also performed for 120 forecasts during a 1-month period to further investigate forecast error characteristics in complex terrain. Results illustrate that forecast errors in near-surface variables depend strongly on the diurnal variation in surface conditions, especially when synoptic forcing is weak. Under strong synoptic forcing, the diurnal patterns in the errors break down, while the flow-dependent errors are clearly shown.},

abstract = {Added value (AV) from dynamical downscaling has long been a crucial and debatable issue in regional climate studies. To assess AV generated by COSMO Climate Local Model (CCLM), a model-reconstructed hindcast with 7 km grid resolution was compared against the forcing data set ERA-Interim (ERA-I) over the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea, with satellite and in situ observation as reference. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments have been used in the investigation of AV by CCLM. Land surface winds, extreme winds, a typhoon, a cold surge and a vortex street have been selected in the assessment process. Statistical analysis on surface winds reveals that high-resolution CCLM hindcast can add value to ERA-I in reproducing wind intensities and direction, probability distribution and extreme winds mainly at mountain areas, which may be related to the highly resolved and accurate description of terrain roughness length and orographic barriers in CCLM. With respect to atmospheric processes, CCLM outperforms ERA-I in resolving detailed temporal and spatial structures for phenomena of a typhoon and of a cold surge; CCLM generates some orography-related phenomena such as a vortex street, which is not captured by ERA-I. These AVs demonstrate the utility of the 7-km resolution CCLM for regional and local climate studies and applications.},

Wind speed and direction from these products were compared to measurements collected at five buoys moored along the Iberian Peninsula Atlantic coast.Results show that WRF modelled offshore winds are the best alternative to in situ measured offshore wind data, showing the highest temporal accuracy (the ability in representing the wind speed and direction at a given time instant) and lowest errors in terms of offshore wind power flux estimations. However, offshore wind data taken from CCMP shows the lowest errors in terms of the mean wind speeds and, together with IFREMER-BWF, the best wind temporal accuracy after WRF simulation. Therefore, in general CCMP and IFREMER-BWF can be considered as the best alternatives to WRF high resolution modelled offshore winds, if the latter is not available. Specifically for offshore wind energy resource assessment, NCEP-CFSR reanalysis or NCEP-GFS analysis data can also be used with confidence as an alternative to WRF modelled data, showing better wind power flux estimates than CCMP and IFREMER-BWF.Despite the best performances of WRF high resolution offshore winds, such modelling tasks require considerable computational resources and time to obtain quality results. Therefore, the value of satellite-derived wind data should not be disregarded. These remotely sensed offshore wind measurements should be seriously considered when searching for alternative sources of wind information for ocean areas, in particular for open ocean areas where they have their strength. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model presents a high surface wind speed bias over plains and valleys that constitutes a limitation for the increasing use of the model for several applications. This study attempts to correct for this bias by parameterizing the effects that the unresolved topographic features exert over the momentum flux. The proposed parameterization is based on the concept of a momentum sink term and makes use of the standard deviation of the subgrid-scale orography as well as the Laplacian of the topographic field. Both the drag generated by the unresolved terrain and the possibility of an increase in the speed of the flow over the mountains and hills, where it is herein shown that WRF presents a low wind speed bias, are considered in the scheme. The surface wind simulation over a complex-terrain region that is located in the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula is improved with the inclusion of the new parameterization. In particular, the underestimation of the wind speed spatial variability resulting from the mentioned biases is corrected. The importance of selecting appropriate grid points to compare with observations is also examined. The wind speed from the nearest grid point is not always the most appropriate one for this comparison, nearby ones being more representative. The new scheme not only improves the climatological winds but also the intradiurnal variations at the mountains, over which the default WRF shows limitations in reproducing the observed wind behavior. Some advantages of the proposed formulation for wind-resource evaluation are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {This study evaluates the sensitivity of wind turbine hub-height wind speed forecasts to the planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme, grid length, and initial condition selection in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model over complex terrain. Eight PBL schemes available for the WRF-ARW dynamical core were tested with initial conditions sources from the North American Mesoscale (NAM) model and Global Forecast System (GFS) to produce short-term wind speed forecasts. The largest improvements in forecast accuracy primarily depended on the grid length or PBL scheme choice, although the most important factor varied by location, season, time of day, and bias-correction application. Aggregated over all locations, the Asymmetric Convective Model, version 2 (ACM2) PBL scheme provided the best forecast accuracy, particularly for the 12-km grid length. Other PBL schemes and grid lengths, however, did perform better than the ACM2 scheme for individual seasons or locations.},

abstract = {Simulating surface wind over complex terrain is a challenge in regional climate modelling. Therefore, this study aims at identifying a set-up of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) model that minimises systematic errors of surface winds in hindcast simulations. Major factors of the model configuration are tested to find a suitable set-up: the horizontal resolution, the planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterisation scheme and the way the WRF is nested to the driving data set. Hence, a number of sensitivity simulations at a spatial resolution of 2 km are carried out and compared to observations. Given the importance of wind storms, the analysis is based on case studies of 24 historical wind storms that caused great economic damage in Switzerland. Each of these events is downscaled using eight different model set-ups, but sharing the same driving data set. The results show that the lack of representation of the unresolved topography leads to a general overestimation of wind speed in WRF. However, this bias can be substantially reduced by using a PBL scheme that explicitly considers the effects of non-resolved topography, which also improves the spatial structure of wind speed over Switzerland. The wind direction, although generally well reproduced, is not very sensitive to the PBL scheme. Further sensitivity tests include four types of nesting methods: nesting only at the boundaries of the outermost domain, analysis nudging, spectral nudging, and the so-called re-forecast method, where the simulation is frequently restarted. These simulations show that restricting the freedom of the model to develop large-scale disturbances slightly increases the temporal agreement with the observations, at the same time that it further reduces the overestimation of wind speed, especially for maximum wind peaks. The model performance is also evaluated in the outermost domains, where the resolution is coarser. The results demonstrate the important role of horizontal resolution, where the step from 6 to 2 km significantly improves model performance. In summary, the combination of a grid size of 2 km, the non-local PBL scheme modified to explicitly account for non-resolved orography, as well as analysis or spectral nudging, is a superior combination when dynamical downscaling is aimed at reproducing real wind},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 Royal Meteorological Society. This work presents a characterization of the surface wind climatology over the Iberian Peninsula (IP). For this objective, an unprecedented observational database has been developed. The database covers a period of 6 years (2002-2007) and consists of hourly wind speed and wind direction data recorded at 514 automatic weather stations. The original observations underwent a quality control process to remove rough errors from the data set. In the first step, the annual and seasonal mean behaviour of the wind field are presented. This analysis shows the high spatial variability of the wind as a result of its interaction with the main orographic features of the IP. In order to simplify the characterization of the wind, a clustering procedure was applied to group the observational sites with similar temporal wind variability. A total of 20 regions are identified. These regions are strongly related to the main landforms of the IP. The wind behaviour of each region, characterized by the wind rose (WR), annual cycle (AC) and wind speed histogram, is explained as the response of each region to the main circulation types (CTs) affecting the IP. Results indicate that the seasonal variability of the synoptic scale is related with intra-annual variability and modulated by local features in the WRs variability. The wind speed distribution not always fit to a unimodal Weibull distribution consequence of interactions at different atmospheric scales. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the temporal and spatial variability of surface winds. Taken together, the wind database created, the methodology used and the conclusion extracted are a benchmark for future works based on the wind behaviour.},

abstract = {AbstractGrid and spectral nudging are effective ways of preventing drift from large-scale weather patterns in regional climate models. However, the effect of nudging on the wind speed variance is unclear. In this study, the impact of grid and spectral nudging on near-surface and upper boundary layer wind variance in the Weather Research and Forecasting Model is analyzed. Simulations are run on nested domains with horizontal grid spacing of 15 and 5 km over the Baltic Sea region. For the 15-km domain, 36-h simulations initialized each day are compared with 11-day simulations with either grid or spectral nudging at and above 1150 m above ground level (AGL). Nested 5-km simulations are not nudged directly but inherit boundary conditions from the 15-km experiments. Spatial and temporal spectra show that grid nudging causes smoothing of the wind in the 15-km domain at all wavenumbers, both at 1150 m AGL and near the surface where nudging is not applied directly, while spectral nudging mainly affects longer wav...},

abstract = {AbstractLimited area models (LAMs) are widely used tools to downscale the wind speed forecasts issued by general circulation models. However, only a few studies have systematically analyzed the value added by the LAMs to the coarser-resolution-model wind. The goal of the present work is to investigate how added value depends on the resolution of the driving global model. With this aim, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model was used to downscale three different global datasets (GFS, ERA-Interim, and NCEP–NCAR) to a 9-km-resolution grid for a 1-yr period. Model results were compared with a large set of surface observations, including land station and offshore buoy data. Substantial biases were found at this resolution over mountainous terrain, and a slight modification to the subgrid orographic drag parameterization was introduced to alleviate the problem. It was found that, at this resolution, WRF is able to produce significant added value with respect to the NCEP–NCAR reanalysis and ERA-Interim...},

abstract = {This study presents results from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model applied for climatological downscaling simulations over highly complex terrain along the Eastern Mediterranean. We sequentially downscale general circulation model results, for a mild and wet year (2003) and a hot and dry year (2010), to three local horizontal resolutions of 9, 3 and 1km. Simulated near-surface hydrometeorological variables are compared at different time scales against data from an observational network over the study area comprising rain gauges, anemometers, and thermometers. The overall performance of WRF at 1 and 3km horizontal resolution was satisfactory, with significant improvement over the 9km downscaling simulation. The total yearly precipitation from WRF's 1km and 3km domains exhibited {\textless}10{\%} bias with respect to observational data. The errors in minimum and maximum temperatures were reduced by the downscaling, along with a high-quality delineation of temperature variability and extremes for both the 1 and 3km resolution runs. Wind speeds, on the other hand, are generally overestimated for all model resolutions, in comparison with observational data, particularly on the coast (up to 50{\%}) compared to inland stations (up to 40{\%}). The findings therefore indicate that a 3km resolution is sufficient for the downscaling, especially that it would allow more years and scenarios to be investigated compared to the higher 1km resolution at the same computational effort. In addition, the results provide a quantitative measure of the potential errors for various hydrometeorological variables.},
